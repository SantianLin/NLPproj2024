I let dry overnight before adding a second coat since it was so thick.', 'Great for many tasks.  I purchased these for makeup removal.  No makeup on your washcloths.  Disposable, so great for travel.  Soft.  Absorbant.', 'These were lightweight and soft but much too small for my liking. I would have preferred two of these together to make one loc. For that reason I will not be repurchasing.', 'This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!', 'I get Keratin treatments at the salon at least 3-4 times a year (would do it more often if I could afford it). I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair. I really like the fragrance, too.', \"I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges). I won't be repurchasing.\", 'This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.', \"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.\", 'Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best. This compact size makes it nice to keep in the center console of his car or to take on vacation with him. Highly recommend!', 'I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!', \"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.\", 'This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly. I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.', \"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).\", 'To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.', \"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!\", \"This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.\", 'I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!', \"I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.\", 'So many great diverse colors', 'Got my new eyebrows in mail today.  Magically my baby caterpillars grew into gorgeous mama size ones.  Papa caterpillar loved the look.  And the eyebrow pen, tweezers and brow shaper templates were just an extra nice bonus!  Thank you.', 'i had a small one  that just got destroyed  these wires are much longer and bigger  i expect to live a lot longer than the tiny one i had !', 'its OK  not as good as the  original Wet Brush  just a knock off', 'nothing special  unfortunately i waited too long to return them ....  no results at all  dont waste your money', 'I love the cocoa butter and shea butter. I hear the shea butter up and whip it until it softens.', \"I think I need to stick with my 5 blade razor. This razor is not only difficult to hold & is made of a hard slick plastic with no grippers, but doesn't shave as well as my 5 blade razor. The style is nice, but the functionality is not.\", 'A total waste of money.  I get better results using a tea bag to alleviate under eye swelling.', 'Didn’t expect much but got a nice beautiful surprise! These are nothing short of awesome. Stay on your head - no matter how big your noggin is or how much crazy hair you have. I need to buy more - my daughters have taken all!! The price, quantity and quality is nothing short of “ best deal ever”!!!!', \"This halo hair extension is simply put, garbage.  Now, you get what you pay for.  And this is a very cheap version.  The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.  I would say this one is a pass for hair loss alone.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.\\xa0 I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 25,000 likes. Bottom line, I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.\", \"I purchased these to see if I could set my mom's hair.  She has fine, thin, short hair and I think these could be fun once in a while for a fluffy set.  Mom is 81.  These are super old school - hoping I can do it with a little foam styling product.\", \"I purchased the tool for my 80 year old mom because she like to file her own toes and fingers.  This tool makes it so she can.  The thing I don't like?  That you have to purchase ALL four files - the buffing files (2 of the 4) are useless.  So - it would be nice to be able just to purchase the green and blue ones.  The buffing files just go into the trash.\", \"I'm a BIG wet nap fan.  Always have been.  They smell good.  They are just the right size.  I carry them every where.  They don't leak like a bottle of hand santizer and fit in any pocket.  1000?  Yeah.  It's alot...but I'm happy to use them freely.  And quit looking for ways to pocket them at a restaurant.  :)  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good shape!\", \"Rrain hats are really handy when<br />one doesn't have an umbrella, and<br />easy to carry in a purse or pocket.\", 'Worked out fine.  Just a bit tight, but o.k.', 'Works very well', 'Normally I like NYX products but not this one.

They wash well in the laundry and don't lose any elasticity\", \"I'm loving this!<br />I've been looking for a great serum for fine lines and have tried many. However my skin can be very sensitive so with many that I've tried, I've found that I wake up with puffier than usual eyes and some have even caused significant flaky dryness. Not this one! Have used nightly for a few weeks now and absolutely no issues. Absorbs quickly, nor burning.\", 'Easy to use', 'Use it for my everyday cologne', 'Wife gave them to a friend', 'Great product', 'These diamond are absolutely beautiful and shine so well.

I don't like it.  Not sure what it's supposed to do.\", \"This mask support works great.  It does what it's supposed to do. It keeps your mask off of your mouth and nose, allowing more airflow.  You mouth and nose are still covered, but the fabric isn't right up against your face.\", \"my hair is long.  It took a long time to get these put in.  The curls were great. These rollers would be great for someone who wants to sleep in them. I didn't find it worth it to use during the day.<br /><br />Good curlers with no heat.  I prefer my hot rollers.\", \"I do like the angle of this dermaplaning blade, other than that, it's basically a razor.  It preforms just like any other razor blade other than the way you hold it.  I can't say it's something special due to this.  The cleaning brush is great and needs to be used since the hair stays in the blades.\", \"4 stars because it pulled my skin off on the sensitive crease on side of my nose.  Just be careful if you have a tough spot upon removing.  You must rewet it if it is sticking too strongly.  I started on that spot and didn't realize it was tearing my skin.  If you follow the instructions, you should have no problem.\", \"I really love this blush it's super cute ultra kawaii and I personally am a fan of the changing pictures that it comes with so it's awesome I guess I just wished it was eyeshadow instead the sailor moon one is also cute but too expensive in my opinion and the blush is not a big deal but this item is more like collection stuff but it's really worth it if you want a cute gift or just something really cute to stare at :) /play with for a bit.\", \"This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.\", 'Had originally planned on using this for my feet but given I have some cracks it mentioned not to use on cracked or hurt feet because it could sting and other similar side effects. I am not sure whether to use this product or not because it also mentioned that it is possible that it will sting whether or not you have cracks on your feet or anything similar. I am a little worried if I should use this at all. I am gifting this away because I do not want to hurt my feet. I hope it helps someone else.', 'Very surprised! I am please with first round on my black, dyed hair. Turned a dark brown! Second round in a couple of days. (Suggest a leave in hair oil from scalp to roots for before and after use) hair is soft after use. Has an odor, but not overwhelming if you cover with disposable hair cap. Easy to use.', \"This lip butter is pretty much a lip gloss. I haven't noticed any lip plumping action, but it is hydrating. It smells wonderful! There's a slight pinkish tinge to it, but it's sheer and not very prominent. It doesn't last very long and does transfer.\", \"I am enjoying this face cream. I find it to be luxurious. It's nice and creamy. The glass jar is very nice. It smells wonderful. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using it at nighttime because it is a heavier cream. I haven't noticed any miraculous results, but I am a regular user of anti-aging products, so I like to think that this is just continuing what's already going on.\", \"This is a good way to use a face oil. Normally I skip facial oils because I don't like the way they feel on my face. This one is mixed with a cream, so it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or oily after applying it. It has a pleasant scent. It isn't sticky though it does leave behind a little tackiness, but that disappears quickly. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do. I like it. It's definitely hydrating. I do think the descriptions are pretty vague. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin, which is always a plus.\", \"I'm in my mid-fifties and I have been using creams targeted to the neck and chest area for a few years now. I have definitely seem some improvement in the texture of that skin. This bottle is very small. It's a lotion consistency and it has a light pleasant scent. It doesn't leave my hands feeling sticky, but the bottle is sticky. I have washed it at least once and it remains sticky. It absorbs quickly. I can't tell if it's doing it's job as I haven't seen any noticeable changes, but it isn't hurting anything either.\", \"This night cream has a good, thick consistency. It's definitely a cream and not like a balm. It has a strong scent to it. It smells like a flowery perfume. It smells nice, but it is strong. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be for you. I don't have any problems with it, though I do prefer citrus scents over flowers, but that's just a personal preference. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It absorbs pretty well.\", \"I really like this face oil by Dose of Colors. It is fragrance free, but it has a light, pleasant smell to it. It does feel a bit oily, but that goes away after several minutes. I'm only using this at nighttime, because it's too heavy for daytime use in my opinion. It doesn't annoy my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling super soft!\", \"I enjoy sugar scrubs! They are wonderful for smoothing rough elbows. This one is a small container. I would consider it more of a travel size or sample size. It smells good. It's got a fruity/beachy smell to it. The scrub has a coarse texture which makes it better for exfoliating, yet I didn't have any troubles with it being too rough on my skin. It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor. I have had some scrubs that leave you feeling super greasy and waxy, but this one is more of a moderate level of greasiness. It definitely softens the skin.\", \"This perfume by Shakira has a pleasant scent. I can detect sweet and spicy notes in it. It is not very strong, which is good. It definitely fades over the course of the day, but I can still detect light whiffs at the end of the day. The bottle is attractive, but the cap or lid is way too plain. You have the sexy body shaped bottle and then there's a little clear plastic lid that has not aesthetics at all. If you could be the lid to anything and doesn't stand out at all.\", \"I am in my early fifties. I have been using anti-aging products for the past several years. This eye cream has minimal smell to it. The consistency is a thin cream. It's not runny, it's just not thick. I have sensitive eyes and this is non-irritating. My eyes water a lot and that often leads to product getting into my eyes and causing stinging and or burning in the eye area. This cream has not bothered me at all. I haven't noticed any difference in the appearance of the skin around my eye, but because I am a regular user of similar products, I really wouldn't expect to see anything new or different. It does seem to hydrate the delicate skin area.\", \"I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.\", \"This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works. When I take it off, it shrinks up again. I like it!\", \"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking. These are also great for travel!\", \"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.\", \"I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.\", \"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.\", \"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.\", \"This set of gel nail polishes comes in a nice variety of colors. The brushes seem fairly comparable to other nail polishes. What I really like is that there is a little window on the front of each bottle that shows you the color. I've ordered some gel nail polishes that have no color identification on the bottle and I have had to paint (and tape over) a small dot of polish so I can identify them without opening. Overall, I am pleased with these.\", \"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.\", \"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.  With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.\", \"I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.\", \"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.\", \"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.\", \"I guess I'm not the right target audience for this Vitamin C/Retinol Moisturizer. I'm in my early fifties. Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin. Other than that issue, I didn't have any other problems with my sensitive skin. Luckily, I have an eighteen year old daughter so I will pass it along to her to use.\", \"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.\", \"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.\", \"Last summer I decided to grow out my bangs after having them for all of my adult life. I hadn't used much hairspray since the eighties and into the nineties, but I found that I needed to spray my former bangs in order to help train them to their new position. This is a huge bottle of hair spray. It has a standard hair spray smell. It gives a nice mist. It doesn't leave my hair crunchy. It's a flexible hold so my hair moves and looks natural. So far I am pleased with it.\", \"As I have gotten older (I'm in my early fifties), I've noticed that my eyelashes have become sparser. This eyelash growth serum is easy to use. It doesn't sting or irritate my sensitive eyes either. I haven't seen much change in the length of my lashes yet, but I think I can see some new growth or density. I will continue using this and update my review if necessary.\", \"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.\", \"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.\", \"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use. As far as I can tell, there isn't a timer on it which would be nice. The bristles are pretty firm. I'm guessing maybe they are a medium. It does a good job of leaving my teeth clean.\", \"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.\", \"My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.\", 'These hair towel wraps are the softest hair towels that I have ever had. They aren\\'t the typical \"dry\" microfiber material that other hair towels tend to be.  My daughter hair goes past her shoulders a bit whereas mine is about chin length. They wraps work well for both of us. They stay in place well and take a lot of the water out of our wet hair. The towel doesn\\'t get too heavy when wearing it either. I love the variety of colors. These really look nice and come in a gift box. They would make a great gift!', \"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.\", \"I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!\", \"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.\", \"I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.\", \"A few months ago I got a vanity mirror that magnifies 5 times. Until then, I didn't know that I had a blackhead problem. I don't always have blackheads, so I don't use this every morning. But when I do notice blackheads, I use this for a few days until they are gone. The product is white and has a very fine grit to it. The grit scrubs away the blackheads. It does not hurt or irritate my skin. It doesn't take a lot for each use so it should last a while.\", \"I am in my late 40's and started using anti-aging products a few years ago. Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem. I'm very happy with this eye cream so far!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.\", \"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.\", \"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.\", \"I burned my back of my hand in a couple of spots this past fall and have been using FLAWless for a short period of time to see if it helps lesson the appearance of those burns. First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result. I am anxious to see what happens after continued use.<br /><br />*I  purchased this at a reduced price for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.\", \"I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great! Each drawer comes with a liner to keep things nice and neat.<br /><br />*I received my acrylic organizer from Marrywindix for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.\", \"I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. I'm not seeing any major improvements with my wrinkles and such, but I am noticing an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. I realize that it often takes longer with continued use before some improvements are noticeable. I'm enjoying it & will update my review after continued use.\", \"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.\", \"First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use! The skin around my scar is super soft.  I may start using this to moisturize this winter.\", 'Needs the charging cord included in the package instead of sold separately.', \"only 2 problems with this product--expensive and hard to get.

This is the first on the market that I know of and it is delicious.There are 5 large deli size slices in a package. I find that a half slice for an open-face sandwich is just the right amount for me. For those of us in the gluten-free community, a deli-style bread is the bread most missed. This Schar bread is expensive but worth every penny! P.S. To follow up on this earlier review, Schar has reduced the size of the deli-style slices to about 2/3 of the original size, AND increased the price!

It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike.

Since the surface area of the brush is small, there is not much hair that is picked up compared to other brushes. Also, I tried several of these types of brushes and this one is not as easy to clean as the others. The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off. Since the tines do not retract fully on the top part of the brush, the hair does not slide off easily. Instead, I have to pick it off.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair. I have three long-haired cats and even though this works some, I am not impressed for the two reasons I mentioned above.

Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked. Therefore, I cannot recommend these if they are being used for resale or as stocking stuffers or Easter basket gifts because the price is actually more than it says on the package.', 'This is a nice set.

It says \"Beautiful girl you can do amazing things.\"<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set.

There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced.

The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99.

The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.\", 'This is a work of art.

What is heart shaped is the plastic holding the two sponges together with the flat side joining into what almost looks like a heart. Nevertheless, I still love them.

As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />Both blenders have a flat side which is great for smooth applications. These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this with the exception that the sponges are on the dense side instead of airy. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too - at least to me. These colors also make it perfect for the Easter Basket.<br /><br />At the current price of $7.99 this comes to a pricey $2.66 per piece if I count the holder. Most other blenders sell for between $1.25 and $1.75 per piece in a set like this but without the heart-shaped packaging.', 'This is a lovely set of three sponges in Easter colors of green, pink, and lilac. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder. The sponges are dense unlike most sponges like this on the market. As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />The one lilac sponge with a flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (pink) and the hour-glass (green) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin.

It is gorgeous and feels great but the material it is made of is so slippery that it keeps sliding off my hair. It is only for this reason I rated this 2 stars as it is not for me.', 'There is one recessed foundation brush in this set along with three blender sponges.<br /><br />The brush is not high quality. I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag. Note that the packaging is more than double the size of the products within. I can fit three sets of these in the box it came in.', 'This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are\\xa0too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.', 'There are 9\\xa0 soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super\\xa0reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.', \"There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eye blending (fan brush), etc. In fact, there are more brushes than I needed.\\xa0<br /><br />The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for; it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional.\\xa0\", 'There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.', 'There are 12 \\xa0supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set with a silicone brush head cleanerbrush that doubles as a mini-brush holder. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />This is an attractive brush set in matte black. Unfortunately, the color of the silicone cleaner cannot be chosen. I thought I was going to get purple to match with my purple bathroom and I received a pink one. \\xa0<br /><br />The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel fantastic against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. The only thing to note is that because the bristles are super soft, these brushes are more suited for powder applications than cream or liquid.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this quality set as it comes to $1.67 per brush or $1.54 per item if counting the silicone cleaner.', 'There are four typical no-frills extra large shower caps (red, tan,\\xa0purple, and black). They fit me but have lots of room to spare. They are waterproof as the water just runs right off the exterior. There is an elasticized strap in the cap that can be adjusted. I adjusted one of them and it looked very lopsided on my head as a result of the adjustment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not my favorite caps. They are too big and the adjustment throws the elastic out of whack. The current price of $11.99 comes to $4 per cap.', 'This clip is gorgeous. If one looks at it quickly, it can easily be mistaken for a tarantula due to the black claws and sort of fuzzy looking applique.<br /><br />I have short to medium fine curly hair and my hair is long enough in the back to use this clip. It holds on to my hair well and looks great. The only negative is that a couple of the beads are loose on the applique. This not only makes noise (i.e. rattles) but creates a situation where they can accidentally be pulled off if the \"plastic\" thread holding it loosely hooks onto something.<br /><br />The current price of $11.99 is pricey for this but typical for a $1.50 clip that is all dressed up.', 'There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma.  I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.', 'The colors and design of these 12 headbands are super attractive. They are all double banded and most have a \"knot\" in the middle that can be worn in the center of the head or at the base of the neck. I personally do not like knots in my headbands but these are versatile enough to position the knot away from the forehead  without losing the good look of the band.<br /><br />The colors are great and there is a design for almost every outfit.<br /><br />Also, the current price of $18.99  comes to a reasonable $1.58 per band. These are definitely pretty and functional and they fit well. There was only one where the material was a hair looser on one side than the other for the top part of the double band. All the others were sewn perfectly.', 'These headbands are made of PU leather with what appears to be a cloth covered plastic base. The headbands look good on and are best on those with a full head of hair since they are so large. The glue of the leather to the material was coming apart on one of mine, so the quality is so, so.<br /><br />However, it also came with two polyester-type cloth headbands, a bow hair tie, and a strip of cloth with avocados on them. None of the cloth bands fit me as they are kid-sized. Also, the material feels scratchy and horrible. The avocado tie is okay and so is the hair tie bow.<br /><br />The curent price of $12.99 ($18.99 minus $6) is too much for this ensemble.', 'This bar of facial soap smells wonderful, lathers well, and feels great using EXCEPT the suds sting my eyes. Also, the bar size is like those hotel travel bars. At the current price of $8, that is absolutely insane. I would not expect to purchase this for more than $2 a bar and that is even expensive for this tiny size. In addition to the price, the fact that it stings if one\\xa0accidentally\\xa0gets suds in their eye is also a negative.', \"I love the results of this lotion. It is creamy and not too thin or thick and absorbs easily. I applied this to my face and neck and felt lightly hydrated. It does say there is a UVA/UVB sun filter in this but it does not say what SPF it is. The only other negative is that it took me about one minute to get the product to dispense from the pump bottle on initial use only. Also note the box is four times the width of the product.\\xa0<br /><br />The current price of $38.40 is pricey for this but it's from France and expected.\", 'I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc. There are two large wands in this package. They are single-sided and have a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end that is good for washing my face with soap and water or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.\\xa0<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the wand bends too easily. I would have preferred if the arm was a bit stiffer to make it easier to work with and allow me to apply more pressure.<br /><br />Overall, this set is excellent and about 7 inches long. It is soft on my skin, pliable, and long enough to hold on to.\\xa0<br /><br />The current price of $9.90 comes to a competitively priced $4.95 per wand.', 'At the current price of $48, this is insanely expensive. Yes the brush is a beautiful blue, with a fantastic gloss, and looks great, feels nice in my hands, and brushes my fine short to medium curly hair well. However, the brush stinks to high heaven and reminds me of the smell of burning rubber tires. Unfortunately, I cannot use this in this condition because I am extremely sensitive to offensive odors.', 'This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of\\xa0 pink, burgundy, and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder,\\xa0a silicone brush cleaner, and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light\\xa0and airy like most sponges like this on the market.\\xa0<br /><br />The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.\\xa0<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.', 'There is a lot of lotion (3.38 fluid ounces) for the $24 price tag. This lotion is creamy and very hydrating. It also absorbs quickly. Unfortunately, I am not at all crazy about the eucalyptus scent. If I loved the scent, this would have received 5 stars from me.<br /><br />BTW, this is good for a man or a woman despite what the title says.', 'There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.', 'There are supposed to be six green and one white scrunchies but I received an additional white one to bring my total up to eight scrunchies. However, only seven are supposed to be shipped.<br /><br />These hair ties are dressy and nice. The scrunchie expands to hold a good amount of hair. Of course, when applying one of these, it is important to turn it so the tail goes down. That can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the seam shows the stitching as can be seen in my photo. They should have covered this with the area that is tied (meaning the area where the tail flows down). This is the only reason I took off one star.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 comes to $1.86 per scrunchie if one receives seven (and not eight) scrunchies.', 'This comb is just beautiful and the quality is exceptional. It is also hefty. As a statement piece it gets 5 stars. However, I find it difficult to comb through my hair using this. I have short-to-medium-length fine curly hair and the tines are so thick on this, that it makes it difficult to pull the comb through my hair. If I had an easier time of it, this would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is reasonable for this.', 'I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.', 'There are two quality headbands in this set. The headbands are SUPER SOFT that I just want to feel them all day. They look great on and I love the design.<br /><br />I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and these work for me and are\\xa0even better for\\xa0someone with long hair. I actually put them over my ears so that they stay put. I have to do that with every headband I use.<br /><br />The current price of $3.99 is a reasonable $2 per band.', 'This is a large oval brush that comes with a cinch pouch. The handle has a good grip due to the silicone \"sleeve.\"\\xa0<br /><br />The bristles are soft and feel great against my face. Initially, there were just a few bristles that fell out but that seems to have stabilized. I use brushes like these to apply blush. The brush head is quite\\xa0large and usable only for larger jobs.<br /><br />The current price of $4.99 is excellent for this in my opinion and one of the reasons\\xa0I rated this 5 stars instead of 4 stars.', \"There are 10 brushes in total and a carry pouch.\\xa0I really love these brushes. The geometric shape of the handles provide a good surface area for gripping each brush during application. The bristles are soft and they do not fall out of the brush. They feel great against my skin.<br /><br />Based on the Amazon\\xa0site, these are the brushes in the set. Note that I cropped a photo of the brushes from the site and attached it to my review, so that one can see each brush's\\xa0use.<br /><br />- powder brush<br />- blush brush<br />- angled contour brush<br />- foundation brush<br />- nasal shadow brush<br />- big eyeshadow brush<br />- small eyeshadow brush<br />- blending brush<br />- eyebrow brush<br />- lip brush<br /><br />In summary, I love that it has more smaller brushes than larger one because they are better for detail/precision applications. The current price of $15.19 ($18.99 minus 20%) comes to $1.27 per brush which I consider reasonable. I also love the color of these brushes as they match my pink bathroom.\", 'This set of two roll-on fragrances comes with a PU leather carry case that will hold up to six roll-on fragrances or essential oils. The lemongrass smells as it should and the protector blend smells spicy. Both of the fragrances are strong. The current price of $19.99 ($24.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for this set. Unfortunately, these scents are way too strong for me.', 'I ordered the orange color. It is very pale and looks attractive in the tube. However, once worn it changed to a light pink on my lips. The moisturizing effects lasted a couple of hours but I personally did not like the look of the resulting color on my lips. Also, at the current price of $18.98, this is very expensive lip balm. Nivea makes colored lip balm that does not change color--so one knows what color they are getting. That lip balm works just as well and is a lot cheaper than this.', 'I got the lavender and balsam fir set of soy candles. Each one comes in an 8 ounce tin. The balsam fir is headache producing to me and I hate it. However, the lavender\\xa0is very nice and a faint lavender scent dissipates throughout my small kitchen when I am burning the candle.<br /><br />Each candle is $20 each at the current price of $39.99. Although they are made with essential oils, I still think that is too much for the set. Unfortunately, only one candle is agreeable to me.', 'There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.', 'This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls\\xa0with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes\\xa0of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.', 'This is a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside is nice but the last two words of \"I WIN!\" may be taken wrong; it depends on the girlfriend.\\xa0<br /><br />TO MY<br /><br />Girlfriend<br /><br />NEVER FORGET THAT<br /><br />I love you<br /><br />THE MOST,<br />I WIN!<br /><br />In summary, this is a lovely gift in a nice gift box. The current price of $22.99 is competitive. I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for the last two words.', 'I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc.\\xa0 This set includes three colorful and double-side spatulas/scrubbers. Also included are two thin purple silicone pads with finger holders that are great for washing my face.<br /><br />Each\\xa0double-sided wand has a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end and another side with larger soft nubs. The nubby side is good for cleaning or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.<br /><br />The \"egg-shaped\" purple pads are great for scrubbing my face with soap and lathering up. I love the nub that allows me to hold on to this.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent set. These are soft on my skin, pliable, and easy to hold on to. I do wish the wands were just a few inches longer for a better grip.

However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done.\\xa0<br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the \"blades\" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of\\xa0$25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this.

The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.\\xa0 The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to.

My favorite bath \"sponge\" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This \"brush\" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this \"brush\" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.', \"I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them.

I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water.

It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.\", \"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case.

It was not easy to get the bar across the \"combs\" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the \"brush.\" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my\\xa0Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8\\xa0since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no \"ball\" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one,\\xa0the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle. Otherwise they work well. The current price of $8.99 is reasonable for two detanglers.', 'There are four tiny colorful squeeze bottles in this package that are easy to fill and easy to dispense. I like that they are portable and can hang on a keychain. These can be used for hand lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, etc. However, the caps do open easily so it is possible the contents will be squeezed out inside a purse if there is a lot of movement. Secondly, the current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for what this is. I would not expect this to be priced at more than $6.', 'I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers.

Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers.

To my senses, it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo).

One has a flat side for a smoother application. The pointed ends are good for more precision. They feel good in the hands and blend well and also wash well with soap. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges.', 'This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.', 'This single layer thin blue shower disposable shower caps are tiny. They are really for a kids head. I can barely get my hair into this. There are 120 (I did not count them) tiny blue slivers that have to be unraveled.

There are 16 to the package and the boards are triple thickness compared to the standard personal-sized ones I am use to. However, the gritty surface on mine started to wear off after a few swipes of my nails over the board. Emery boards in general do not last long; however, the size and thickness coupled with the limited longevity makes me not like these. They do file the nails but they do not last.', 'Surprisingly, I really like this mask. I already tried their\\xa0[[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2\\xa0WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]] and found it to be very messy and just okay. This one is less messy.<br /><br />There are ten individually wrapped masks in this package. The instructions are in broken English but still easy to understand. I applied this mask to my clean face -- there are holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. It was somewhat wet but not dripping wet as their other mask. I prefer less solution, so\\xa0this was perfect. I let it stay on for exactly 20 minutes and then removed the mask and wiped off the excess. My face felt moisturized and silky. I reveled in the soft rose fragrance the entire time.\\xa0 However, the claims that it brightens the skin and protects them from wrinkles is unfounded in my opinion. On the other hand, the rose fragrance is calming and wonderful and the moisturizing effect is silky and these are my two favorite traits of this moisturizing sheet.<br /><br />\\xa0', 'This pick is absolutely terrible. It is made of flexible plastic that is easily breakable and the pick ends are so thick, they are like scaled down hammer claws that do nothing to scrap the teeth. It went right in the trash.', \"This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner.  I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.\", 'This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.', \"These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.\", 'I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.', 'I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety.', 'I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the \"compact pallet holder\" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger', '[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.', \"I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.\", 'I purchased the shampoo at CVS several months ago and I absolutely love it. I have fine wavy hair and this shampoo really brings out those curls. I would definitely purchase again. I have not tried their conditioner yet but will some day soon.', \"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.\", 'Works great for rhinestoning, made the process faster than the previous tools I’ve used', \"This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it’s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we’re on the 25th day of Geologie’s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I’m most impressed with- this hasn’t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I’m sure it’s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I’m not even sure how it does it, maybe it’s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son’s for past x3 months and I’m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn’t have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I’ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can’t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I’m so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.\", 'So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4”) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who’s always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it’s hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you’re norm is the “frozen gel look!” Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It’s feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear… It’s just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we’ve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we’ve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it’s not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!', 'This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin.

This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia’s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I’m certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment. As for now, this is doing just fine- and best of all leaves baby smelling amazing!!<br /><br />So, if looking for a product that is gentle enough to use on a newborn… That has taken the precautions to keep their skin safe… Using only natural products- and has the ability to moisturize and even clear up cradle cap.. just a few drops of this to the bathwater- can handle the trouble spots no problem.. loving it!!', 'Yes, it does smell good...', \"We've been using their products for over 5 years now and it IS one of the best.\", 'Easy to use.

In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It’s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven’t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don’t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress – my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they’re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It’s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.', 'I selected this little hair remover/shaver for my wife, to replace a trimmer she had simply worn out over time. This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators. After one use, my wife is very pleased with it.<br /><br />This trimmer is similar to a rotary shaver that men use to shave (except one head instead of three) and is similar in size to a glue stick. It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me – she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish. This is absolutely not the job for which this little trimmer was designed, but apparently it will work in a pinch.<br /><br />Compared to other trimmers she has used, this one is very gentle and when it’s turned on it doesn’t sound like it’s laboring like some of the others do.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little hair trimmer, designed for facial hair.

I cant get them to clasp, even when they are not in my hair. This was a huge waste of money.', 'Adorable! I love the super soft fabric and the quality stitching. I did not realize these were not stitctched to appear to be tied,  which I really like- Mommy actually ties it to create a custom fit for their baby’s head. Perfect!!!

It looks just like my natural skin when applied. I purchased my Aeroblend system in November, and it's Wonderful! Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin. I am so glad I purchased my Aeroblend system!\", \"very impressed with this!

It has great ingredients I just wish they had another option for a bigger bottle 😍🥥🥥🥥💝 I used this moisturizer on my boyfriend's face and mine and we both loved it :)\", 'These shiny facial massage cryo sticks chill quickly, and I love that they come packaged within a clear plastic storage case with an instruction card! You can actually hear the anti-freeze/non-toxic liquid gel floating and bobbing around inside each stainless steel spoon/orb, and I love the ergonomic shape of each tool! The brightly colored turquoise handle tips help protect my fingers from the cold, and these futuristic-looking devices sit and balance nicely on various parts of my face! They do a great job of reducing swelling, puffiness, and fluid retention, and I think they’d make an affordable and unique gift for fans of at-home, cold therapy techniques! ☃️', 'I absolutely love this dual-headed face roller!! It’s gorgeously colored, easy to hold, attractively packaged, and competitively priced. I especially love using it after I’ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin, and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!', 'The lavender bath bomb and rose-scented bath bomb and soap bar all feature light, feminine scents that pair nicely with the included candle! The stainless steel cup seems well-constructed and nicely sized, and the various tools and bottle openers are an appreciated bonus. This boxed set is ready for gifting and even comes with a blank card that can be easily personalized to some lucky recipient. I think this grouped assortment offers a nice variety of different and relaxing products that most customers would enjoy!', 'I’ve used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it’s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!', 'I like the details of the twist-front designs on these stretchy headbands, and all of the fabrics feel soft and lightweight. Each one is easy enough to wash, and they come in a wide range of attractive colors, so I usually leave a couple in my car for unexpected hikes and impromptu workout sessions. They’re also great for holding my hair back during morning and evening skincare sessions, so I’d gladly recommend this multicolored variety pack to others!', \"I think this is a great set of utilitarian beauty tools! If you've ever tried to apply a goopy face mask with just your fingers (looking at you gold-infused charcoal paste), then you know the struggle that often comes with scooping up products and then trying to spread them evenly before they start to dry in place. These bendy silicone-tipped spatula brush sticks and paddles streamline the entire process!<br /><br />All of the tools are lightweight, easy to clean, and they seem to be fairly durable! I love the candy-colored palette of pastel hues, and the various textures and tips offer plenty of versatility and flexibility. They are also great for hygienically scooping up globs and dollops of various creams and moisturizers that need to be kept as sanitary as possible for repeated applications. I'd definitely recommend this tool set to others!\", 'These medical-grade silicone scar removal sheets are so versatile! Acne scars, burn scars, and post-surgical scars all benefit from the consistent application of this painless product, and I love that it’s a viable alternative to topically applied creams and gels. I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference. Scars slowly start to fade as the skin regeneration process kicks into high gear, and these sheets are actually reusable, washable, flexible, breathable, and easy to apply!', 'I have tried and tested many rollers and scrapers recently, so I inspected this duo closely. The gold hardware on this dual-ended roller seems reliably attached, and both ends roll freely, but the larger end does seem to have a small issue that causes it to bump with each revolution, preventing the rolling motion from being completely smooth and silent. That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and “v” angle have some rough, white areas they don’t look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree. This set comes attractively packaged, and it seems to be affordably priced, so it might be a great choice for consumers looking for a starter facial set!', 'I’ve greatly enjoyed using this organic clover honey face mask! The texture is smooth and dreamy, and it seems to offer me a very nourishing skin treatment every time I use it. It rinses away cleanly after 20-30 minutes of wear, and I also love that this bee-powered skincare product is made in the USA, so I’d definitely recommend it to other consumers in search of a honey-infused facial concoction! Oh, and both the glass jar and paper box are recyclable, so it’s an eco-conscious pairing all around. 👍🏽♻️', 'This multicolored variety pack of headbands is so eye-catching, and the entire set has been quite affordably priced! Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure. The decorative plastic buttons on each side can sustain some pull, so I believe that they’re there to optionally provide a resting place for the ear loops of face masks. Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I’d gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!', 'This foaming cleanser genuinely provides an oil-free approach to daily acne control. I like that it contains botanical extracts, and it seems to provide a gentle, yet thorough, clean! It’s nicely packaged, affordably priced, has a pleasant scent, a 2+ year shelf life, and it always leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and smooth. I’d recommend it to others without hesitation!', 'I can honestly say that this was the first time I’ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I’m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it’s worth giving these a try!', 'This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don’t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that’s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn’t have any product leak out during shipment. There’s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle’s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family’s hands feeling nice and soft every time. I love using essential oils to help provide a renewed sense of revitalization and freshness around my home, so I’m gladly adding this Canadian hand wash to my daily cleansing arsenal.', 'This is the first time I’ve ever used a stainless steel version of a gua sha scraper tool, but I’ve been decidedly pleased with the overall results! I love the super slick, shiny surface of this heart-shaped piece, and it’s always cool to the touch at room temperature. It’s comfortable to hold, has a very slim profile, and it always immediately provides a relaxing sense of rebalanced alignment. This gua sha tool also comes with a pink polishing cloth and a red leather storage pouch! The snap is secure and reliable, the stitching is straight, and the scraper device fits snugly inside. I’m really pleased with this product overall!', 'These do make affordably unique party favor gifts! The holographic print diamond ring designs are pretty, and I think the featured wording is memorable and cute! I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I’ve tried, so they don’t seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I’m generally used to, but they do make a nice “ring” design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I’d received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged. They’d make great gifts for bachelorette parties or bridal shower events!', 'This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it’s super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it’s soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it’s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I’ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I’d recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I’d realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I’m pleased with its overall performance!', 'Vitamin C is definitely an essential component of a healthy body and skincare routine, and I love that this smooth cream also contains shea butter, vitamin E oil, rosemary, jojoba oil, aloe vera, cocoa butter, and lavender essential oil. This lotion has a pleasant scent, and it seems to work great with overnight applications. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time. I love that this product is USDA-certified organic and that it’s made in small batches in the USA! The tub comes adequately sealed with a clearly marked expiration date, and I think it’s affordably priced for the results it provides. 🌤', 'I love this skincare set! The pale pink rose quartz hue is such a pretty shade, and the paired duo arrives safely nestled within a cushioned pillow of foam cutouts. The dual-ended roller exhibits smooth and silent movement, and the gua sha stone is perfectly sized and comfortable to hold! The warm gold metal hardware pieces complement the pink color beautifully, and the overall craftsmanship of this set is impressive. This product would make a chic and affordable gift for yourself or a loved one!', 'The blend of royal jelly, botanical, and floral extracts gives this Korean beauty essence a nice ingredient profile, and the overall scent is pleasingly fresh and sweet. Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I’d prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall. Due to the compact size and flattened shape, these pouches would be great for travel. Especially after a day at the beach!', \"These nipple covers aren't perfect in every way, but they do offer some reassuring coverage! I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they’re super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don’t peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don’t stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I’d have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I’ve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.\", 'This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I’m thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn’t be more pleased with this product.', 'This face wash provides an invigorating sense of clean with a burst of fresh citrus zing! I love that it contains aloe vera, vitamin C, rose hip oil, and lemon and orange peels! 🍋 It goes on smoothly, rinses off easily, and seems to have an ideal consistency. I have gladly added this vegan product to my daily skincare regimen, and I’d order it again without hesitation. It provides smoothing, hydrating, radiant results and it smells incredibly delightful!', 'This is a beautiful and affordably priced facial set! The Brazilian rose quartz stones are a pale shade of pearlescent pink, and the rose gold hardware is the perfect complement to them! The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don’t seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance! This would definitely make a perfect gift set for someone!', \"I have thick, wavy hair and need a thick brush. Over a decade ago I discovered that boar bristles work best, but finding one I can take with me was a process. I didn't like those with exposed bristles, so there weren't many options. This is the first folding boar-bristle brush I found.<br /><br />The plastic is light and gives the impression that it isn't of the best quality, but it's survived my backpack just fine. This is a portable brush, so using it requires more strokes through my hair, but that's a price I'm not hesitant to pay. It's come in handy for my kids too, who also have the same hair-and-brush combination.\", 'Love it', 'This is an amazing contour pallette', 'Works great', \"I've been using this product for over 10 years.

Definitely a good one in my book!\", \"This kit comes with everything you need to take off nail polish.<br />This particular set was for my mother in law who is just getting into gel polishes and she didn't understand what the clips were for at first 🤣<br />After I showed her how it took off the polish with scrubbing she was SOOOOO glad I got her this set!\", 'Never tried poly gel before, definitely not easy but worth it! Check out my nails in the photo, came out beautifully and they are very strong!', \"I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish.<br />It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change.<br />I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!\", \"Great for your pores and acne. My husband's back started breaking out and after using this for a few days it's clearing up and looks less irritated.

Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest, nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.\", 'I am so glad they made a product like this because I can never seem to find the right color to match my skin and I end up with that Foundation the line on my chin with the two different colors.

Great travel bag.', \"Despite having a thick-ish, creamy consistency, the conditioner not only dispenses without issue, its also easy to work into/rinse from hair. Does a nice job of protecting color while detangling and softening. However, I don't really notice any added shine or volume.<br /><br /> I'm beyond thrilled to say it has the unique Moroccanoil product scent that not only smells lovely but actually lasts for a decent amount of time; a rarity with my hair!<br /><br />I love Moroccanoil products and while I do like this, its not my favorite in the line.  I have no plans to purchase this in the future, I'll stick with their hydrating conditioner.<br /><br />Overall score is 3.5 stars\", \"This is a very reasonably priced exfoliator that does a great job of exfoliating and cleansing as well as hydrating and smoothing.  Its packed with antioxidants that are excellent for good skin health.  The instructions says to use 2-4 times a week. I use it twice a week and follow with a good facial moisturizer. I can't say that I experienced a change in my aging skin but I also haven't been using it very long. There is a nice scent that is pretty much gone once the product has been rinsed off.<br /><br />I  have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues using this.\", 'This is an ideal moisturizer for my dry, sensitive, aging skin. It applies easily and absorption is fast. Does a nice job of calming the patches of eczema while moisturizing and firming. I like the ingredients, especially the cactus oil. There is a scent; its a nice scent but it fades quickly. The price is on the high side but worth it.', \"This is a nice, light gel cream packed with aloe and hyaluronic acid, 2 things I love to use on my dry, sensitive aging skin. Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo). Despite this, its still a good, affordable cream that works well on even the driest of skin.\", \"While XXI Bio-Pure facial moisturizer is packed with great skin care ingredients such as jojoba, shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower seed oil and glycerin, I think its the Vitamin C that really makes this an exceptional product.  At least for my skin it's exceptional.<br /><br />This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn't cause skin to look/feel oily or greasy.  It softens and smooths skin. Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed.  And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow.  I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.\", '\"Best shave I\\'ve ever had.  Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor\".<br /><br />That\\'s the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT\\'s  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn\\'t pivot  but it doesn\\'t need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn\\'t tip or wobble.<br /><br />He\\'s not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must \\'really rub it in\\' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended', \"I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.\", \"I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!\", \"John Frieda's Detox shampoo/conditioner duo is an excellent way to revive and restore hair. The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair!  Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well.  I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!\", \"I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel.

The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!

I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!\", \"Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.  I absolutely recommend Huxley.\", \"I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!\", \"EXURE is a pretty impressive leave-in conditioner that does a great job of softening and smoothing my hair. Its packed with an impressive array of nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants that protect and heal damaged hair while also adding shine.  I don't need to use very much on my shoulder length hair.  EXURE has a fabulous scent as well.  I don't have any issues with EXURE weighing my hair down or making it look/feel oily or greasy.\", \"Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!\", \"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!\", \"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays. My review will be updated if she has better results than I.<br /><br />--photo #1-taken right after I put some mask on my hand<br />--photo#2-taken after mask sat on my hand for 15 minutes (doesn't dry entirely)\", \"Somehow, I managed to dodge dark circles under my eyes for most of my life...until a few years ago. Now, they're the 'norm' for me.  Same for puffy eyes. FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.\", \"My husband has dry skin that is worsening now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis.  I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.  He's definitely satisfied with this cream and the results he is receiving thus far.\", \"I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful\", 'If you\\'re a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8\"tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn\\'t use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog\\'s paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn\\'t thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn\\'t really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won\\'t see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn\\'t enough to clean Mac\\'s muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don\\'t see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don\\'t see a  difference.', \"You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!\", \"Boy oh boy, does my dry, sensitive skin LOVE LOVE LOVE Higher Education's Goal Digger cucumber creme!  This is a wonderful  lightweight creme packed with important nutrients such as:  cucumber extract, kale, melon, cabbage, ginger and turmeric, to name a few. Together, these ingredients hydrate and soften skin and do so quickly.  The creme applies nicely -a little goes a LONG way. My skin absorbs it very rapidly and it does not leave a greasy/oily feeling.  It has a nice, light, refreshing  cucumber scent.  This creme will not make your wrinkles and fine lines vanish entirely but  will help visibly reduce them.  If you have dry, sensitive skin you're going to want to try this creme. It will do wonders for your skin!\", \"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment! (I told my mom about my success and she already ordered one of herself !lol )<br /><br />Photos:<br /><br />#1-wearing the 'socks', #2- day 2, #3-day 4, #4-finished<br /><br />Day 5\", 'A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I\\'d ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn\\'t take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I\\'d tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I\"m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you\\'re dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.', 'Very “rusty” color.', 'Of course, I love Tréstique, but I especially love this lip primer!  It’s not chalky nor sticky, but provides a great priming for Tréstique lipsticks.  I like the primer so much that I purchased them for all of my Tréstique lippies, as opposed to balm that comes with the glosses.  It gives your lipstick longevity and allows for fullest pigment payoff!', 'Simple, thoughtful design.  Priced right.  I use this to allow brushes to dry after washing.  Works perfectly!', 'I Love these hats for bedtime, Keeps my hair in place and looks cute. And stays on good. Thank YOU', 'Try as I might, these clips simply would not stay in my thick hair.

Thick hair weighs a LOT and this bird nest hair clip just adds more weight and since my bun isn't on top of my head, the clip's weight pushes my bun off the back of my head. I had high hopes for these cute clips, but unfortunately they are a no go for me. I've donated them to my local women's shelter.\", \"I got this KLAVUU Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack and have been using it nightly for a few weeks now. I have found that it is tasteless, odorless and does give me very soft lips by the next morning. However, it is extremely thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very well. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't attracted to and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a pass for me.\", 'Easy to use, my face was noticeably tighter the next morning and the price is right on point for the pack of 10 that you get.

But I got these and they stay put! I am SO happy that I don't have to mess with a falling ponytail all the time anymore! The colors are very nice and the elastic is the best I've ever found in a scrunchie. I will be buying more in other colors!!\", \"The cuticle oil is so very hydrating. My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked and this oil really helped them not only look better but feel so much better! I appreciated the easy roll-on applicator too. The body lotion is a decent lotion. I wouldn't say it is earth-shattering or mind-blowing.. but it does smell really good and the scent isn't too overwhelming or powerful. My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid. Overall, this is a nice set and gift-worthy, but I probably won't purchase it again.\", \"I got this CURECODE serum in hopes of introducing more moisture to my dry face (gotta love winter). The very first thing I noticed was that, while there are directions on the box, there are NO instructions on the bottle itself. I'm not in the habit of keeping the packaging (who does that?!).. they need to add the directions onto the bottle label!<br /><br />The serum itself is pleasing. There was NO scent (THANK YOU!), my sensitive skin had no negative reactions at all and I was pleased with the thickness. It didn't completely absorb into my skin.. I had a few pieces of pillow lint (flannel sheets) stuck to my cheeks the next morning. I can't say how well it works long term yet, but I have high hopes as my skin was more supple the next am.

It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown.

I've worn these lashes all day and even slept in them a night or two just to see how well they'd hold up. They held up amazingly. I've purchased an additional black and clear eyeliner to go with my kit. I prefer these over the magnetic eyeliner with magnetic lashes because it concerns me that the magnetic eyeliner may be found to have adverse effects at some point. Oh, additionally, this eyeliner goes on so well as a good as the adhesive works with the lashes it doesn't have a tacky feeling on your eye.

It's quite loud at full power, but you can adjust the speed up and down depending on your needs. Most importantly, it effectively sucks in dust when you file over it, helping to keep down the scattering of nail dust all over yourself, your clothes, your work surface, etc.\", \"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.\", 'This is a light cream that makes your skin feel so smooth and yummy.

Why any manufacturer would use it in this day and age baffles me. Unless it was about planned obsolescence all along.

The way the bristles are angled makes the brush upside-down in a left hand.  Sure, you can use the long bristles, but that defeats the purpose of the angle which really does make the brush go through whiskers more easily.  We Southpaws are very used to this.  So many products designed to fit in a hand are made for the right hand, which makes them awkward or ineffective (like scissors) for 10% of us.  When that happens, I find that I don't reach for that item as often, or I avoid it altogether, and, sadly, this fine brush sits seldom-used in my bathroom.

It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it\\'s on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband\\'s) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it\\'s not much more than a pretty face, and isn\\'t for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There\\'s a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it\\'s time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you\\'re pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There\\'s a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men\\'s facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You\\'ll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn\\'t very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don\\'t need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007', 'We like this product very much', 'These are one of the best make-up removers!!!!', 'I use this as a refill replacement on my heat embossing pad....works great!', 'It works ok.

The booklets are smaller than a credit card size and you can use these very discreetly, while at dinner or cocktails etc. No need to go to a restroom to re-apply make up. Really good in hot sunny weather when oils really  pour out of your face.<br /><br />My friends marvel at the results when they see me tear out this little piece of paper and gently pat my oily face.  I have had to order for several of them.<br /><br /> I have several booklets which I keeps handy - one in the car, in a few handbags. Note - make sure you get the right shade -  I am darked skinned - the Rachel is perfect.

Packs of 4!', 'Love these toothbrushes!', \"This stuff smells. A lot. And it lingers for hours. I actually ended up washing my face all over again to get it off before going to sleep.<br /><br />The lotion itself is smooth and didn't irritate my skin. It seems to absorb reasonably fast as well. But....that awful smell is a deal breaker for me.\", \"I don't really have any use for the gloves included in this set. The curry comb is what I wanted. It works like it should and removes excess hair without pinching. Our donkey seems to really prefer a curry comb to any other type of brush and he likes this one.\", \"I've been using this on my feet rather than my face. It's just too heavy and thick for a face cream. After 4 days, my heels are definitely softer.<br /><br />It seems to absorb reasonably quickly, but slower than my usual moisturizer and skin cream. I can't detect any perfumes in this and that's definitely good.\", \"Good grief.  If you have thick, long hair,  avoid these. The decorative bead things catch my hair and pull. Not cool. There is also less stretch and elasticity in these than with regular scrunchies- with thick hair that means these won't last long. Perhaps if your hair is very fine or very short you can make these work,  but I can't stand them.\", \"Between regular,  every day germs and now Covid-19, we go through a bunch of sanitizer. It's in the cars, the house, the horse barn and luggage. We tend to use Purell in the giant wall dispensers in the house and barn, but these big bottles are nice too.<br /><br />The sanitizer smells like what it is. This seems a bit thinner than the Purell, but dries quickly enough. I haven't noticed any sticky residue left behind or excessive drying of our skin. I'm taking one of these with me to West Texas tomorrow for use in the truck and cabin. It fits nicely in my overnight bag pocket.\", \"Wipes like this are a fill in for actually washing your face with real soap and water,  but they do come in handy sometimes.  I was using these after working horses and shoveling stalls. The wipes are thick enough to get the grime off without tearing. However, after three days, my face broke out in two spots! My friend tried them and after three days, she says she's fine. So it's just me I guess.\", \"I have very thick, very long hair and I work with horses and dogs daily. That means I've got a pony tail every day with a scrunchie. This one is a pretty deep green and it holds my thick hair well. The silk doesn't create friction or split ends and that's good. However, you only get one of these for the price and that is just ridiculous. This thing is no different from any other scrunchie out there except for the silk fabric and that still doesn't make it worth fifteen bucks.\", \"As much as I hate to admit it, getting close to 50 brings lots of unpleasant changes and some great ones. One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br /><br />This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.\", \"I'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market.

At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.\", 'I use this in rotation with a couple of other brands.

I prefer frosts or pearls, and pinks. My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I\\'ve already opened it, I can\\'t return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I\\'d never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It\\'s like the 1950\\'s). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish\\'s kryptonite!

I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container.

The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.', \"Primer, liquid Foundation, BB cushion, and a flat kabuki brush. I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093GFPFP9<br /><br />I am not sure if Nude (#102) is the lightest shade they have or not, but if you are like me and have fair skin with cool undertones this may lean a little warm. It isn't bad, but if they had a better match available I would want to get that.<br />THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZ6QZLJ/<br /><br />The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest. If you need coverage with a natural look.. try this!\", 'Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word \"matte\" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren\\'t wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn\\'t feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I\\'m not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all. I find that it nearly matches a bold lip tint that I like by \"I\\'m Meme\"<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091GSRN78/', 'Smells SO Good!!!  I\\'ll add in some pics as the product pictures shown here dont do this justice. The contents are in a sturdy flip top box makes it look like a gift (and was shipped in a regular box, maintaining integrity of the product box). Almost reminds me of a subscription box as the deign on the outside gives it a special look. It kinda threw me off because I nearly expected more of a generic look. I thought, ooh did someone send me something? lol. But no, I ordered this lol<br /> Once I opened the box, a colorful, glossy card stock card with the phrase, \"Happy Birthday to You\" on one side, and totally blank on the other. This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I\\'ll use everything. Personally, I use bath bombs in my shower as I dont take baths, or I use as a foot soak.', 'What doesn\\'t work for my hair, works for my cats. That is our agreement. So these are pretty much a pack of cat toys as I prefer hair bands that fit comfortably on my wrist. These have plenty of stretch, but elastic is tight when retracted. Good or bad depending on needs. So too tight for me to keep on wrist. These are ok if I keep them tucked into a drawer and I grab one as I need one. They have good snug elasticity for thinner hair. My hair is thick, but I can use them for the ends of my hair when I put my hair in a braid. I dont like them for pulling all my hair back. These won\\'t be a repurchase. They\\'re \"ok\"', 'This is a package of 15 individually packaged biodegradable wipes. All of their products come in 15, 30, or 45. This 15 pack at $8.95 makes them $0.59 each. Easy to open, all tucked into a flip top box<br /><br /> Excellent for on the go, for travel, for whenever. I have used a variety of Busy Co wipes, and I have liked them all, some more than others. When I selected this, I chose it after taking a look at the ingredients (how I always select items to buy or to try). So it was weird not to see direct ingredient list on this product page. I have included the ingredients here:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice<br /><br />This unscented GLOW formula is aimed toward those seeking to BRIGHTEN SKIN, IMPROVE DRY SKIN, and REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN.<br />Not sure who is trying to use this on babies, but this product is not marketed for that use.<br /><br />I use this on my hands and feet, prior to bed. Then I add my lotions. The wipe does a good job cleaning my skin and nails. Adds little hydration. Could use them being a little more damp, but they do work. I have a couple tucked into my purse in case I just need a wipe, but for the most part I am keeping these for night time use. While I think this product is ok, it isnt a must have for me, and I likely wont repurchase. But I do like other Busy Co products, and have found that they are a better fit for my needs (and have been repurchases).', 'Nice feeling moisture boost. Lightweight, nothing oily about it to me. My dry skin loves a good hydrating toner, and this fits that need. I pat some on all over face, neck and chest. Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.', 'So calming, nourishing, moisturizing, revitalizing. $35? Great price point. What a treat! I recommend! Love it!<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry but clear skin (no acne). Minimal lines. Overall healthy save for redness & visible veins from Type 1 Rosacea (no bumps, no acne, just redness).<br /><br />Reminds me of some of the thick, luscious, rich leave on night \"masks\" that I use. Really nice used alone, or paired with their real ampoule drops, or with your own routine. Just slather on, allow some time to absorb before hitting the pillow. Wake with supple, soft, dewy, nourished, revitalized skin. I\\'m impressed.<br /><br />I haven\\'t had skin procedures, but this seems like a go-to item if I were to ever have something done- whether it be professional dermabrasion, laser, basically anything that leaves skin a little raw and exposed for a few days and would benefit from a more healing like cream.<br /><br />the drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP', \"I really like this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion. I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps). ALL that I have tried by Organa Cell has been gentle, no discernable scent, absorbs well, and feels good on the skin. Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases. Take my money, haha<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.\", 'Supremely soft. Seriously, the first thing you will notice is how incredibly soft these are. Really good quality, and attractive. I immediately recommend them, haha. Has a good stretch, fits my large head without feeling irritating (kinda forget it is on), and it stays in place. What is this sorcery?<br /><br />If I experience anything else while wearing these, I will come back to update. My initial and immediate impression was just so favorable that I had to jump on a review to say so.<br /><br />Currently $3.99 for a set of two. Good deal', 'It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn\\'t take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn\\'t matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br /><br />DARK HAIR option: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JCXT18<br /><br />PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too.

Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until you see fine powder particles falling onto your hair. 4. Using a makeup brush or your fingertips, massage your shampoo into your scalp. Brush as usual, or (for extra body), use your fingertips to massage the shampoo into your hairline.', \"My skin is dry, totally clear (no acne) save for some redness & visible veins from Type 1 rosacea. This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase. I do like Fascy Lab products, so it's a contender.

The most gentle of all the physical exfoliation out there. If you haven\\'t tried it, I highly recommend. I also highly recommend anything by Easydew. Good stuff!  Know that this is meant to clump! Not supposed to have lather or creaminess. I had looked at the ingredients and some of the description and I suspected a gommage. The directions on box say to use on wet face and that it will lather. It doesn\\'t. There is some clumps, but not as much as if it were used on a dry face, which is what is expected from a gommage. We want glorious clumps! For best results use on a clean dry face, not a wet face. I have tried it both ways, definitely use on dry face. Works but not as good on wet face.<br /><br />So use a generous amount. Just pat it in all over. Let it sit a moment, then massage it in in gentle circular motion. As you do so, small clumps will form. This is a combination of product and grime and dead skin cells. Basically, a \"gommage\" is like an eraser on a pencil, and your skin is paper. The graphite marks are dirt and dead skin cells. The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those \"marks\". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle \"peel\". And quite effective. But less so when used on wet skin-- the ingredients just can\\'t grab the gunk on face as well. I\\'m surprised there is such a discrepancy in instructions.<br /><br />Instructions on container:<br />\"How to use:<br />Apply desired amount of peeling gel and work into a rich lather by wet hands.<br />Gently cleanse by massaging thoroughly over face in circles, avoiding eye contour.<br />Rinse off with lukewarm water.\"<br /><br />But the pictures clearly show what is expected--balled up bits/clumps.<br /><br />SO, it it may be a matter of terminology/language.

My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum.

My bottle was hard to get open, and once I did I could immediately tell that the oil had oxidized. Totally unusable as it was truly rancid. The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air. This is going to do exactly the opposite of what you want. Again, I give benefit of the doubt. I imagine it was a bad bottle and hopefully not at all what anyone should expect. Even so, I have to rate what I have.', \"I've used fiber lash mascaras before- they usually have a pronounced effect, and is why I wanted to try this Kissio Derol mascara. The thing is, it doesn't do anything for me. I am perplexed. I applied the primer (comb brush with hairs/fibers), then followed up with the bushy brush mascara. And.. nothing. I can not see even a miniscule amount of added volume or length. Not even more than a basic mascara. Initially it had not bothered my sensitive eyes for the first few hours but then my eyes started getting itchy and irritated like they had something in them-- the fibers were falling off into my eyes! My eye where it was most bothered was red. I'm done with trying mascara unless it is a known brand.<br />Sad :(\", 'I\\'ve only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks \"thinner\" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin\\'s collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin\\'s damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin\\'s tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum', \"This review is for the foot wipes only. I was intrigued as I do foot masks once a month, and I am always otherwise giving my feet attention every night. Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.\", 'I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I\\'ll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * \"It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean\" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.', 'I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn\\'t look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn\\'t for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

Quite an uplifting aroma. thyme, rosemary, sage, lemongrass..mmm. Natural chlorophyll and organic cloves create a deep green color. The soap has lather, soft clean feel. I use this as a hand soap, but it can be used all over anytime- very nice soap that inspired me to see what else they have to offer. Not knowing anything about Elsha, I learned that it is a USA company that was established in 1935 offering cologne products, and eventually perfume and soaps. These soaps are handmade in USA. Although the eagle on a flag shield screams, \"\\'merica!\", the product listing would do well to say this (their other listings do). The box that the soaps come in are gray with an Elsha sticker on it. No information as to what it is, what is in it, where it is is from, etc. If there was at least an insert of information I would feel better about buying this as a gift. The website had produced just enough information to make me feel better about trying this soap, otherwise I had no idea what was in it or where it originated.

Then next one I tried just wouldnt stay put. I tossed it out. Tried another.. same. Tried another. Tried another.. same same. So tossed out remaining 4.<br /><br />This is not the silicone masks that are just silicone and are worn overnight. It's a neck treatment, very similar to facial masks. It is a juicy serum saturated mask that gets applied to the neck. If you already use facial masks, then you know that you will be wanting to pretty much lay down  or recline back a little while the treatment is in place (20 minutes) lest it possibly move or fall off. Very similar to facial masks!<br /><br />The material is on the larger side, and actually covers quite a bit of neck skin.<br /><br />I use all sorts of skin care products, so I cant say for sure how effective the treatment ingredients are. I do use facial masks, and adding in a neck treatment is nice-- just adds to the home spa self care experience. I love facial masks, and I think if you enjoy personal care goodies like this, then you will enjoy this as well.<br /><br />Individually packed in a pleasant looking box, they could be given as a gift, or parted out and shared with others.\", 'I fell in love with Easydew products awhile back. I do tend to use and try all sorts of products, but I have a short list of products that I really like for me. Easydew is on that list. Easydew is also a brand I trust. I just sense that it is doing what it says it is going to do. Budget friendly too. They dont use frilly words and overinflated promises. They just seem straightforward with science backed ingredients. I like that a lot. I think all or most of their products include EGF (epidermal growth factors) which I am keen on for skin repair and health.<br />I haven\\'t used an easydew product yet that I didnt like or love. This Repair Control Renewal lotion always feels so good on my skin. I love it for my simple skin days. It has so much going for it-- addresses a multitude of concerns- and is gentle. It is one of those lotions that just make the skin look and feel good immediately. If you have dry skin, their toner is pretty great too.<br /><br />My skin: 40 something, dry skin. Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight \"mask\" or occlusive.', 'Easydew is skin care that is functional, effective, and always seems to live up to the expectations. I happen to like EGF (epidemal growth factors), and if you don\\'t then just don\\'t purchase Easydew DW-EGF products. I recommend doing a quick search to learn more about \"EGF in skin care\". I\\'ve been a fan for awhile now, so I was stoked to try this face wash. I use other Easydew products with success.<br /><br />My 40 something dry skin benefits from the gentle, hydrating cleansing. It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Not taut.<br /><br />Dont need much. First couple of times I squeezed out what I was used to using with some other cleansers. This is thick, and once you add in a little warm water it takes off with lather. If you end up not loving it for your face, it would make for a fabulous shaving cream and/or body wash. This tube will last a long while no matter what you use it for.<br /><br />I use a two step cleansing process most nights of the week. So that means starting off with an oil cleanser to help dissolve stubborn grime and products (primarily my SPF, but make up too), then using a gentle water based cleanser to actually wash away was was broken up and left behind. Some nights I can get away with just a water based cleanser. Mornings I use just water based cleansers. So really I can use this any time.', \"Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin. Not sure what I am feeling. Its odd.. but it doesnt impact overall look, feel, or performance.\", 'I dont love the color for me, but I like everything else enough that I am am considering trying another color. I like to keep my make up simple, so I often go for an eye shadow pencil; something I can swipe on in a single color and be done. I often go for very light colors, or even more into brown or purple. This \"chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl\" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do however love the ease of use, how it does not irritate my eyes at all, and it just goes on so smoothly.', \"Lovely gentle and effective balm to oil cleanser. I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.\", \"I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.<br /><br />One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.<br /><br />Love their designs on the bottles.<br /><br />Water, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Guar Gum, Lemongrass Oil, Orange Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lemon Oil, Rosemary Extract, Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product)\", \"I like it. I'll use nearly anything so long as it doesn't dry my skin out, and even better if it has healthy ingredients. This hits those marks, and at the new low price of $5, it is a pretty decent body wash (originally I have it written down at just under $20). Obviously this is a much more budget friendly price. I have a facial cleanser by Hylunia I really like, and this has a similar feel to it. I would use this on my face while in the shower with no problems. It is gentle and non irritating!<br />It isn't super sudsy, but it lathers plenty enough to feel like I am covering my body and cleansing it. I always follow up with a moisturizer, and I thought my skin actually felt extra soft the next day (I take my showers before bed). Smells good!\", \"This contains retinol, so plan on using sunscreen as well as retinol based products can make skin more sensitive to the sun. It is a dry oil, so it soaks right in and doesn't sit on the skin. Don't need much, but I tend to use a generous amount anyway since my skin leans dry. I use it on my face during the day, and I like it mostly for my neck and chest as I already have a dedicated retinol product I use on my face a few times a week at night.<br /><br />There are several skin loving ingredients in this product that I like, and my skin seems fine with this product. I have rosacea (redness/visible veins) and aim for more gentle products. This contains fragrance as an added ingredient, but it doesn't seem over powering.

I like that they are made in USA, handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small, but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn\\'t just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.<br /><br />\"CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients.

While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier. Got super sensitive skin? work on repairing that skin barrier before anything else.<br />--NO added fragrance in ingredient list. No naturally occurring scent either. I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry. I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product. I am a little early on writing this, but my skin is used to centella asiatica as well as EGFs, and with some Isntree products.\", \"My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.<br /><br />1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications.

Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care.

However, for whatever reason, it contains \"parfum (fragrance)\" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.

I love making little self-care packages to hand out, and while I will buy and use masks in the $5-35 range, I prefer the $1-3 masks for the token give away (think: facial mask, hand cream, lip balm, etc.. tiny cheap self care packages). I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to.

I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a longer term use item.

Maybe I haven't found the right product yet to use on top. When I apply makeup, in no time the skin looks like it is peeling heavily, but it is just the product peeling off. Even when using a little. This is the worst I have ever experienced with any product. Again, it might be what I have tried it with. And by itself.. seems totally fine. Your experience may vary.<br /><br /> Use a light hand, as it seems it doesn't take much to cover face, neck, chest. So, little goes a long way which is a good thing.<br /><br />Worthwhile to try.\", 'This Juicy Chemistry face & body scrub is a very mild, and seemingly gentle \"scrub\" chock full of great ingredients. For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The \"3 stars\" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, \"for face AND body\" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn\\'t happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn\\'t dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don\\'t like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not \"keep it on until it dries\" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at. Could be worthy as a gift if this seems like something someone would like.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List:<br />Sucrose*, Coffea Arabica Seed (Coffee)Powder*, Theobroma Cacao(Cocoa)Powder*, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Citrus Sinensis (Sweet Orange) Essential Oil*, Vanilla Planifolia (Vanilla) powder*, Simmondsia Chinensis(Jojoba Oil)*, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Oil*, Coffee Infused Oil*, Tocopherol^, Helianthus annuus Seed Oil, Rosmarinus officinalis(Rose Mary Antioxidant) Leaf Extract.<br /><br />\"Formulated especially for dry skin, this scrub brings together the classic combination of Coffee and Cocoa with a hint of Sweet Orange.<br /><br />Cocoa has powerful antioxidant properties that help to heal damaged skin and other skin ailments. It helps renew and promote healthy cell development. Ground coffee beans gently exfoliate the skin and also reduce the appearance of cellulite and stimulate skin cells.<br /><br />The fatty acids and Vitamin E content of Hazelnut oil help create a natural oil barrier that helps skin retain water and avoid drying out. It also contains tannins, a powerful antioxidant that help cleanse and shrink pores. Vitamin E also helps with collagen synthesis and reduce the appearance of scars.<br /><br />High Vitamin C content in Orange makes skin radiant and also helps in collagen production resulting in supple, hydrated and age-less skin.<br /><br />Sugar acts as a natural exfoliator and helps to gently remove dead skin and impurities making it radiant and softer.<br /><br />Rich in fatty acids and natural vitamins, Shea Butter moisturizes the skin to relieve dryness. A super-hydrating blend of Cocoa Butter, Natural Vitamin E, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil makes skin softer and smoother.\"', \"Quick absorbing, non greasy watery hand & body lotion. I like my body lotions to be on the thin side as I find it easier/quicker to apply as well as quicker to absorb. When I have extra rough spots, then I don't mind using a thicker emollient. But for just out of the shower lotion to lock in moisture.. I want a thinner lotion. This provides that. Yet, it is moisturizing enough to use any other time of day. Leave at kitchen sink for hand moisturizing as needed is great too. But not at bathroom sink lest someone mistakes it for toothpaste, haha. It is in a toothpaste style container. Just flip cap and squeeze.<br /><br />It feels nice on skin, has no added fragrance. I like their 1513 face lotion and I like this hand/body lotion too. I tend to have dry skin, so I find both are better for me for summer or days I just a light hydration boost. Easy to use, no frills lotion that is gentle on skin. I appreciate the nourishing ingredients and that they offer a no fragrance added option. Any hint of scent is entirely naturally occurring. However, this may not be for you if you seek to avoid essential oils as is is listed at the end.<br /><br />Overall it is a nice product. No irritation. No issues thus far.<br /><br />Key Ingredients:<br />--Rose Flower Water: Helps maintain the skin's pH balance<br />--Organic White Willow Bark Extract: A natural exfoliant that helps reveal brighter, radiant skin; Acts as an astringent and anti-inflammatory<br />--Aloe Leaf Juice: Hydrates and helps to lock in healing ingredients • Hemp Seed Oil: Treats inflammation and redness<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Emulsifying Wax, Witch Hazel Water, Vitamin E, Sunflower Seed Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Organic Hemp Seed Oil, Rose Flower Water, CBD, Organic White Willow Bark Extract, Organic Rosemary Leaf Extract, Organic Neem Seed Oil, Organic Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Essential Oil\", 'FULL ingredient list:<br />Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Avocado Fruit Oil, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Glycerin, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Stearic Acid, Vitamin E, Sunflower Seed Oil, Organic Neem Seed Oil, Organic Rosemary Leaf Extract, Organic Sunflower Seed Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Rose Flower Water, Rosehip Seed Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, Vitamin A Ester, Vitamin C Ester, Provitamin B5, Allantoin, Organic White Willow Bark Extract (Salix Alba), Organic Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, CBD<br /><br />KEY Ingredients:<br />  * CBD: Formulated with 750mg of CBD; Acts as a powerful antioxidant that reduces free radical damage<br />  Rosehip Seed Oil: Moisturizes and brightens skin; Improves texture<br />  Carrot Seed Oil: Heals and balances skin; Address fine lines and wrinkles<br />  Provitamin B5: Stabilizes skin’s barrier and helps skin retain moisture<br /><br />*\"Research is mounting on how CBD helps our body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS) increase oil production in the pores and in turn drastically reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles\"<br />(if this is accurate, then having naturally oilier skin is indeed one way to fend off lines and wrinkles. Oilier skin tends to age better. I have dry skin, but I have been moisturizing and protecting with SPF since my teens).<br /><br />MY skin: Mid 40s, very clear, very fair, minimal/no lines, supple, leans dry, has Rosacea (non-acne, just flushing and redness from visible veins). My skin loves hydration, oils, thicker heavier products.<br /><br />This product:<br />--stay fresh, pump style tube container (think of a toothpaste container with a pump)<br />-- thin, light, but rich lotion.<br />--smooth, glides on<br />--absorbs quickly, no lingering sheen or greasiness.<br />--plays well with other products (ie; toners, serums, SPF, make up)<br />--gentle, non irritating.<br />--skin nourishing ingredients<br />--no added fragrance; barely there naturally occurring scent.<br /><br />When I use it: daytime after serum (if I use one) but before SPF.<br /><br />Quite a range of experiences and preferences, but that make sense since we all have different skin and skin care needs. So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn\\'t seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don\\'t feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn\\'t feel like it is drying, it doesn\\'t give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.<br /><br />I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don\\'t want to fuss.<br /><br />Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.<br /><br />Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.<br /><br />I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars', 'Individually wrapped cleansing cloths that are way better than any other I have used in the past. The material has a good strong feel, and it is large enough that it nearly feels like a washcloth. I can really get my hand on it. The packets easily tear open. The cloth, once wet becomes crazy sudsy. It has a barely there scent. I really have to sniff to be able to detect anything. Very fresh.  The lather is gentle and non drying. I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a \"bird bath\" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that... I didn\\'t look.<br /><br />But for travel: definite yes. I would go so far as to use one in the shower to take care of face and entire body. The cleanser is so gentle, which is a huge draw for me and my dry/rosacea skin.', \"My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive*, clear but with redness/visible veins (rosacea).<br /><br />My skin has been really loving this Easydew Daily Double Hydra moisturizer. I love K-beauty products and hadn't heard of this line. I am glad to have been able to try it as it just works really well for me. I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference. Seems to play well with other products (SPF, serums, masks)<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077BTR9H4/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp<br /><br />As someone who engages in hobby skin care, I like finding through trial and error items that I would buy again, or would be my go-to if I had to choose just a couple things. These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.\", 'Interesting array of ingredients. The predominant scent (and minor, initial flavor) is that of seaweed, since that it the primary ingredient. It doesn\\'t come back up in burps like a fish oil can.<br /><br />I have been taking this for 2 weeks now. I did not immediately start with a full 2 caps does as I wanted to make sure that I could tolerate the new ingredients. I can. So then about a week in I began taking two caps. I know I have forgotten a dose or two, but I am through 2 of the six blister packs, and just starting my third. I am embarking on a multi pronged approach to my massive shedding cycles. I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an \"off shedding cycle\", or my approach is working. I don\\'t want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks. BUT I\\'m not too far off, so maybe?! I am keeping track, so I will be back to update as I go. Currently, I feel fine taking this, and it never makes me feel nauseous.<br /><br /> It is a 60 capsule (30 day) supply.

Upfront expectation to really know if it is working seems to be around 3 months-- which would be true of any product of this nature.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT: Within the one full pack of use (some skipped doses), I can tell there is less hair fall. This makes the first benchmark accurate. \"After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling\". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, \"After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen\" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).', 'The \"Drop the Bomb\" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: \"Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine\"! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won\\'t even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn\\'t grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my \"reapply\" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn\\'t even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn\\'t really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.', \"First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea. I can only tell you that my brushes always come clean, so far.<br /><br />Also, fits nicely in my make up box!\", 'I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, \"made for USA but made in China\", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn\\'t tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn\\'t bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n\\' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive \"natural, healthy\" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes \"4D silk fiber lashes\", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn\\'t matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.', \"Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.\", 'Oops! I didn\\'t realize when I ordered this that it says, \"medium\" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don\\'t see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won\\'t use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, \"a sun kissed glow\".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn\\'t notice the \"medium\" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a \"sun kissed glow\". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn\\'t feel heavy, and it doesn\\'t feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don\\'t like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.', 'I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn\\'t used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted \"sheet mask\". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn\\'t sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth. Softly cleanses skin, non irritating.<br /><br />--Skin soothing: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a soothing benefit to skin; helps create bright skin. Centella Asiatica has potent antioxidant properties, rich source of amino acids, and there\\'s additional research showing that it\\'s a good hydrating ingredient to soothe upset or compromised skin.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Charcoal Powder(310ppm), Peat Water, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Allantoin, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Propanediol, Citric Acid, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Alcohol, Rutin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA', 'This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain \"parfum\" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn\\'t cloying. So I don\\'t know. I\\'m afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn\\'t do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn\\'t have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven\\'t had a headache, and I don\\'t actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn\\'t there, thankfully.<br /><br />I\\'d boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, \"No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes\", and \"parfum\" is on ingredient list- and doesn\\'t say where that is derived from.', \"These are great. I love the look- nice colors and design. Just the right size for travel, and are TSA approved sizes. Easy to use, easy to clean, good seals. I don't travel much but my husband does often for work- sometimes by plane often by car. Either way, he has to pack toiletries. With six squeeze bottles and 3 tubs, he has some and I have kept a few for my own use. The fact that they are BPA free food grade silicone opens up some options for use of these bottles- whether traveling or for out and about (work lunches!).\", 'WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2\". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5\". Many are 1\" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won\\'t lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can\\'t read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don\\'t over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn\\'t grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.', 'So much better results than a manual toothbrush. So much better than a battery operated toothbrush. This really does a good job getting the teeth and gum area clean. Definitely helps in keeping mouth healthy. I have a used a few brands and they all do a good job- some last longer than others, some have replacement heads that can be purchased as generic, some dont. I usually purchased the name brand replacements. Anyway, I was always happy with my toothbrush.', 'I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (\"anti-fouling rubber stopper\"). It doesn\\'t come attached, and I wish it did since I\\'d rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We\\'ll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.', 'I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don\\'t want to sound cynical, but I really don\\'t want  you to spend money where you don\\'t have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don\\'t let this more expensive \"deplaning tools\" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, \"WAND\") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, \"deplaning\" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don\\'t fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it \"deplaning\") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn\\'t just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn\\'t great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What\\'s in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, \"deplaning blade\") in each handle (ie; \"wand\"). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don\\'t expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The \"wands\" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the \"instructions for use\" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don\\'t like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.', \"It doesn't perfectly straighten the hair, but it definitely smooths it out, getting it pretty close to straight. The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results. I like the ability to use a fine water mist- this helps to smooth out the hair.\", \"Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better. In my 40s with barely emerging fine lines, I am all for doing what I can to keep those at bay.<br /><br />As I learn anything new, I will add to my review.\", 'Works easily and well.', 'Really cute wig that looks natural on.

The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne\\'s World\" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled \"Wayne\\'s Power Minute\" (1987) on the CBC Television series It\\'s Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto\\'s overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from \"Wayne\\'s Power Minute\"), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show \"live\" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first \"Wayne\\'s World\" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season.

This brush is round and has nylon bristles. The barrel of the brush is open allowing air from the blow dryer to pass through. Instructions are on the box.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Argan-Infused Round Brush to family and friends.\", 'This bag Makeup Sponge Beauty Blender is nice. I tried out a few of them and I am happy with them. I think my favorite is the little wedges. I find them helpful for getting around the eyes, nose, and mouth than with most makeup sponges.<br /><br />The bag comes filled with sponges. There are diamond-shaped sponges, wedge-shaped sponges, rectangle-shaped sponges, and round sponges. The thicker ones are pink, and the thinner ones are yellow. Instructions were not included in the bag.<br /><br />I will be recommending this bag of Makeup Sponge Beauty Blender to family and friends.', 'This Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover is great. I used it to remove my Christmas gel nail polish. I was surprised at well it worked.<br /><br />The box comes with a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle of gel nail polish remover and a pump bottle. It also comes with a pack of cotton pads and a pack of nail clips. Also included is a file and cuticle pusher. Instructions are included.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover to family and friends.', 'This Acrylic Nail Brush Set would have been nice, but my fine liners are messed up. I have tried to fix them and so far, nothing works. Not impressed.<br /><br />The tube comes with 8 brushes in different sizes and brush types. These brushes are used to decorate the nail when the brushes are in good shape. There are no instructions included.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Acrylic Nail Brush Set to family and friends.', 'These Nail Art Brushes are pretty. I love the shape of the handle and the color. I like the 6mm size best.<br /><br />The box comes with 6 brushes. Each brush is a different size from 6mm to 11mm. There are no instructions for cleaning included.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Nail Art Brushes to family and friends.', 'This RSTYLE UV Gel Nail Polish Set is beautiful. I love the red and will be wearing it very soon. The white I will be wearing but I will be using nail art paint with it.<br /><br />The box comes with 4 bottles of gel polish. Each bottle has the color of the polish on the top of the cap. There are instructions for how to apply the gel polish. It does not include a UV lamp, base coat, or top coat.<br /><br />I will be recommending this RSTYLE UV Gel Nail Polish Set to family and friends.', \"This Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit is nice. I love that I don't have to put on a base coat first. This nail glue is a base coat and glue on in one bottle. I also love the gemstones.<br /><br />This kit contains a box of soft gel tips. The box has sections inside dividing the different size nails. There is also a number on the tip of each nail. Also included in the kit is a pair of edge cutters, a file, a pack of gemstones, a small UV lamp with a USB cord, a bottle of top coat, and 2 bottles of glue.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit to family and friends.\", \"This Makartt Nail Decoration Set is gorgeous. The only thing I don't like is the static in the containers. The pieces attach to the top of the container until you open them and then little pieces go everywhere.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plastic tray with 12 small containers inside. Each container opens and closes with a screw-top lid. Be sure to set the container in something before opening it as the contents will go everywhere, especially the small things. The containers have beads, gemstones, and charms. There are also 3 small sheets of stickers included with the kit.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Makartt Nail Decoration Set to family and friends.\", 'This WALRUS OIL seems to work pretty well. I have two tattoos that were looking a little dry. I put some oil on them and they did brighten up some. I will continue to use this to see if it improves more over time.<br /><br />The pack comes with one 2 ounce tin of vegan oil. It does have a slight scent but it is not overpowering at all. This product is for new and old ink.<br /><br />I will be recommending this WALRUS OIL to family and friends.', \"This Simple Pleasures Kit is cute. I think I might have clicked on the wrong thing. This looks like a child's set.<br /><br />The kit includes two separate sets. One has a separator and 6 small bottles of polish. The other set has 4 larger bottles of the colors in the first set. This one has nail stickers included. These polishes are water-based and kid-friendly.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Simple Pleasures Kit to family and friends.\", \"This Mini Nail Dust Collector is nice. I would have loved to have instructions included with the collector. I did go on the purchase page to see that I needed 2AA batteries. There is one part that I still don't know what it is for. I did a test and it did work and I am happy with that but instructions would have saved time.<br /><br />The box comes with the collector. It has two little tools include. On small brush and I don't know what the other thing is.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Mini Nail Dust Collector to family and friends.\", 'These Crystal Glass Dappen Dishes are so cute. I got them for slip solution. I may also use one for polish remover.<br /><br />The bag comes with two cute dishes. Each dish is clear and just deep enough for slip solution or polish remover. The plastic bag reseals so the dishes could be stored if needed.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Crystal Glass Dappen Dishes to family and friends.', \"This Havtyyise-3 set is nice. I really like the hand mitt. The holes on each side are better than the ones with no holes. This made it easier to get the soap on and keep the mitt on all at the same time.<br /><br />The set comes with a mitt, a handled back scrubber, and a pouf ball. The mitt is the best in the back and the back scrubber comes in second. I do not like the way the pouf ball is made and I don't see it lasting very long. It just flattens out because it is poorly made.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Havtyyise-3 set to family and friends but I will let everybody know about the pouf ball.\", \"This JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband is so cute. I loved how it looked when my hair was in it. I waited 4 hours and my hair still wasn't dry so it didn't curl. I will be trying it again.<br /><br />The box comes with a hair curler and clips. It also comes with 4 scrunchies, 2 large and 2 small. There is also a beautiful, drawstring bag to store everything and instructions.<br /><br />I will be recommending this JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband to family and friends because it is so cute.\", \"This Women Ultra Smooth Razor works well. It glides smoothly and cuts great. My problem is I don't see a place to buy replacement heads only razor blades. Instructions say to replace the blade every two months.<br /><br />The pack comes with a base, handle, and two razor heads. The razor heads have covers on them and they are magnetic. There are instructions but it does not say where you can buy replacement heads.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Women Ultra Smooth Razor to family and friends.\", 'These HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips work great. My hair is not thick but these clips stay in my hair. I am impressed at how well they work.<br /><br />The pack comes with 4 large clips. The teeth of the clips go inside each other enough to hold the hair. The colors in my box are white, pink, black, and brown.<br /><br />I will be recommending these HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips to family and friends.', \"This Silk Exfoliating Mitt is soft. I used the mitt on my face. I can not tell any difference between this mitt and any other mitts except that it is soft. No difference in the skin.<br /><br />The mitt fits the hand for cleaning. The resealable package comes with a mitt. It says 100% silk but I'm not sure I would agree with that.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Silk Exfoliating Mitt to family and friends.\", 'This NULASTIN - Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser works great. I put it on my palms and then put it on my face in a circular motion. It felt great.<br /><br />The cleanser has a pleasant smell. It has an exfoliating cleanser and a moisturizer. It makes the face fill great.<br /><br />I will be recommending this NULASTIN - Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser to family and friends.', 'This DARKLATER Tongue Scraper is not worth the time. I used both of the scrapers. I could not tell a difference after using them. I am not sure if I was doing it right but it did not come with instructions.<br /><br />The set comes with two scrapers in a metal container. Both of the scrapers are metal with a copper look. I did go to the Amazon website to see if there were instructions. What I found was a section for Videos. Under that was this: Help others learn more about this product by uploading a video! Then a button that says: \"Upload video\". I will not upload a video just to help others learn about the product when I don\\'t even know about the product!<br /><br />I will NOT be recommending this DARKLATER Tongue Scraper to family and friends.', \"This Pre-stretched Braiding Hair Purple is pretty. I got it to put in my mannequin's hair. I make handmade scarves, hats, and other things that would look great with this hair. I was surprised at the amount of hair I got.<br /><br />This hair is beautiful. There is 8 individually packaged purple hair. Included with the package is a latch hook but not beads to attach the hair.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Pre-stretched Braiding Hair Purple to family and friends.\", \"This Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller is beautiful. The roller doesn't appear to do anything for my facial skin. I love the jade that is why I gave it a two-star rating not because it worked for the skin.<br /><br />This set comes with a large almost heart-shaped piece of jade. There is a roller with three pieces of jade. I will be using this jade in something else.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller to family and friends.\", 'These Daletu Nail Tip Clips work great. I put on the nail and then clipped it to my finger. It helped the nail stay in place while it dried. I think they will be good for other crafty things too.<br /><br />The clips are clear and they are not too tight on the fingers. They come individually packaged. Because they are clear it helps to get the clip in the correct place on the nail.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Daletu Nail Tip Clips to family and friends.', 'This HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss is bright red. I have fair skin so this \"gloss\" made me look like a corpse. It is also supposed to be a moisturizer but it made my lips crack and peel. Not happy with this at all.<br /><br />The lip \"gloss\" comes in a little tube and you brush on the color. If you have a different skin type than mine you might like it but it did chap my lips. I would think twice before getting this product.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss to family and friends.', 'Colors are beautiful!', 'Beautiful, thank you!', 'Loved that this came in a gift basket, very cute! These all smelled great and were a lot of fun to use in the bath!', 'Works great and very easy to use! A great kit for people just starting out with nails. I also use it for various other things that I need to sand down a bit around the house, it works great on multiple things! Definitely recommend!', 'I used this when I had a cold and it was really relaxing and soothing. Helped my sinuses quite a bit. Definitely recommend this!', \"This cleanser works great. It starts off kind of like shaving gel and then like shaving gel you can form a foam by rubbing it on your face. Leaves my face feeling very clean but doesn't dry my skin out which is a bonus! Definitely recommend this stuff!\", \"Great set that gives you smooth skin for your foundation makeup. Too heavily scented for my liking so I took a star off for that. This isn't the best primer I've tried in this price range but it works. A decent quality product that doesn't irritate my skin.\", \"Beautiful! I'm so excited to wear it for my wedding.\", \"I hate greasy moisturizing creams that sit on the surface of my skin and clog up my pores, which, I'm afraid, is most of the moisturizers out there, but I do need something for my aging face in our dry, high altitude  home, especially in winter. This serum is easy to use and absorbs quickly. You apply it morning and evening with or without other creams. It won't make deep wrinkles disappear, but if you use it consistently, you will probably notice a positive difference in your skin, I know I have.\", 'Christmas gift that was loved.', 'Great price for the quantity.  They work great!', 'This bag is way smaller than I expected but still useful for small items such as tampons or toothpaste. Truthfully, I will probably just trash it or give it to my 8 year old after my vacation. I had originally rated 1 star but upped it to 3 because the seller was very attentive. My issue was addressed promptly.', 'These are pretty colors but even with a base, filing all along nails and a top coat, they peel right off.', \"First, these are so super cute and I loved them when I first got them. However, the love quickly faded as I started using them. While they totally work and hold your hair up, they break very easily and I have very fine thin hair. So, if they break so easily with my fine hair, then people with thicker hair, well good luck. These are better for looks than actually using them to hold your hair, and that's not what I was looking for. So, while these are super stinking cute, they don't really work holding your hair without breaking.\", \"Cute nails but some of the sayings just don't go together and would have been better just plain.\", 'These nails are super cute and wear beautifully. Love them.', \"Beautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again.\", 'I love using this set when I am wanting to really go all out for my makeup. It makes everything last so much longer and looks so beautiful. It works great with my foundation and all of my makeup. It feels great on the skin and makes my skin so soft and smooth. It also does a great job hydrating my skin and getting it ready for makeup. Everything just works great together and love using it.', \"These are very much for the more experienced eyelash wearer as they only have a tiny string to work with and not a strip. So I have to say that if you can't work with just string lashes then do not get these. However, if you don't mind then these are great. They look beautiful and blend in so well that people honestly can't tell they are false lashes.<br /><br />I honestly love them and they look very natural and beautiful. Would be happy to buy more later on.\", \"I'll admit that I do have a nail addiction and I do my nails all of the time. Honestly, it's much cheaper that way. Anyway, normally I don't fool with pushing my cuticles because I'm always loosing the wooden pushers and they always go so dull after using them for a while. Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price. Couldn't recommend this enough to everyone.\", \"I am totally disappointed with this headband. One it is super cheap and easily bendable which means it will break easily. I have very fine hair so this headband is just horrible with my hair. It sticks up at the top and doesn't hold any hair back because my hair just slides out of it. Now, if someone has very thick hair then this would work perfect for them but for someone like me with very fine hair, this headband just isn't right for me.\", \"I have to say that I honestly didn't think this stuff would work or it wouldn't last as long, it would look strange, or that it would make me look plastic like. I didn't know what it would really do but I gave it a chance and tried this stuff. Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural. Key word, natural. I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face. I couldn't believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up. This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman's make up bag.\", \"I am very pleased with my experience using the Feminine Cleansing Wash. This is very easy to use in the shower as it has a hand pump. The scent is light and pleasant, yet doesn't leave a lingering perfumed odor. I have found that 'regular' soap does me no favors for cleaning my groin area as it's much to harsh for my lady bits. This is a great product to use for those of us that are mindful of our personal hygiene and want to be ready for any situation that comes up between showers. I find this to be a good value for the quality. I certainly will be making this wash a regular order in the future. I hope my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.\", 'I am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included. I hope that my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.', \"I am very happy with my order of the Gershion Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set. These are great to use as it's a nice and even texture. The colors are great for me to use under different stamps, stencils and with stencils for nail art. They also look great as plain colors under a glossy or matte topcoat. I find that it dries easily under my 36 watt lamp. I find this set to be a good value. I hope you find my experience helpful as you kindly click the button below.\", \"I have been very happy with my order of the USB Nail File Machine. It works well and is easy to use with the USB cord. I often use this with a battery pack. The accessories have served well and after several months of use are still in good shape. It does great for my nails, but I also use this on my feet. It makes my self-mani and pedis quick and easy. The handle is easy to grip. Speed is quick, but not so much that it's difficult to control. I find that this is a good nail drill for personal use, but I wouldn't recommend it for multiple users as it does start to get warm in my hand when I am finishing on myself. I find it's a very fair value. I hope my experience is helpful and you kindly will click the button below.\", 'There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.', 'I have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit. Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand. Thanks for reading, if my experience is helpful to you, please click the button below.', \"I'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.\", \"The anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!\", \"The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!\", 'Love this scent ... soft and long lasting when used with the lotion and perfume!!!!!', 'Great product, Great hair remover, I loved it!

All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!

It works as well as acetone to remove nail polish and doesn't give off a headache-inducing smell when doing it.  In fact, there is a slight perfume smell to it.<br /><br />The only thing to note is that it leaves the hands oily after use, but that's not a big problem at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended because it is much less harsh than the traditional method and even more recommended for anyone who gets a headache from the fumes.\", \"I got this for my son who is obsessed with my little pony.<br /><br />The tail is basically a hair clip with synthetic hair glued to it.<br /><br />The wig tends to shed a bit but that's normal for synthetic hair.<br /><br />The wig had inner straps to tighten it to different head sizes.<br /><br />Overall a decent little set for play time.\", \"[[VIDEOID:bb5d02bd6cdc2aacb49b1a0f62af91fb]] My husband is a professional tattoo artist and he is always looking for the newest and best equipment.<br /><br />Tattoo machines are an important part of the tattoo process so having a machine that preforms well is a must have.<br /><br />The description says this machine is a 3.5 stroke but after using this my husband would have to say he believes it to be a 2.8 stroke in his professional opinion.<br /><br />When doing the tattoo he had to make several passes to get the line bold enough in the skin versus his other machines. He said this would be fine for doing black and grey tattoos but it is not a good machine to pack color.<br /><br />The machine is bulky and fits in the hand nice. There is no added weight and it doesn't feel uncomfortable in the hand.<br /><br />This is a rotary machine so traditional clip cords are not compatible with this.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent machine.

It seems to grab the makeup and hold it on longer. Weird I know it isn't the intended use but it works! I also use it after I've done my make up to set it. If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery. Definitely has a scent of Rose with a bit of a witch hazel after scent.<br /><br />The spray itself is medium mist and covers the entire face with one burst.

Collagen is key to healthy, youthful looking skin - certain ingredients have been found to promote collagen production. This product incorporates the best ingredients known to increase collagen in facial tissue.<br /><br />In addition this Sunrise Serum has lightening agents that work together to smooth and even skin tone.  I was especially interested in this aspect as I have a few sunspots that I want to lighten.  Over the several weeks of using this twice a day I can see that it is gradually lightening them. Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I’m seeking, but based on my initial findings I’m confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend.

Smells great and feels like it rinses out completely but as for conditioning? It just sort of works. So, nothing too special but it doesn’t suck.', 'Great product.

It's easy to hold even for extended periods of time. It's not a rechargeable product. It must be plugged in while using. It is painless. I don't wear the super dark glasses. I just close my eyes. I use on underarm too. I will keep it up, I'm just sorta lazy.\", 'Wonderful lip balm. Creamy, not waxy and stayed put. Smells luscious and sweet. I feel like this hydrates for at least an hour too. No stinging upon application. The lids audibly \"clicks\" when closed so you know it shut. 45 spf too.', \"This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend.

The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.\", \"I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone.

And hair is soft.\", 'I only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable  difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes.', \"This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.\", \"There's not a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well.

I'm still working on getting it the correct size for my head size. I have very thin hair which might be the problem.<br /><br />There are tons of videos about different hairstyles with halo hair extensions. Plus lots of different updos because YES you can have an updo -- buns, pony tails, braiding etc, -- with these extensions.<br /><br />Much easier to brush/comb you hair with the halo than with taped extensions. It is NOT itchy like most wigs I've invested in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!\", 'I love this stuff, especially for the price. I was looking for a benetint dupe.

Makes hair look really cute on a bad hair day.', \"I have naturally curly hair and don't like to straighten my hair very often since it is so time consuming.

They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.', 'This mannequin head is great for the price. It includes the clamp, and the hair is very thick.

But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily.

My son has long, curly, coarse hair. This set works on all of our hair types! The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray.

It’s very easy to apply, just like clear liquid eyeliner. It’s good that it does not irritate my wife’s sensitive skin at all.

My skin has always been good, and I have taken care of it for most of my life, so I had a good place to start from, but I am beginning to see the crowsfoot lines fading, the dark shadows fading, and the general quality of skin even nicer.<br />FYI I am very fair skinned (red hair, white skin, green eyes type of Irish) so not sure how it would work on dark skin, especially African, but it doesn't feel like it's corrosive so might be OK.<br />You really only need a fingerprint's worth for each eye area, so it is going to last a long time.  In 2 months I am less than half way through the jar.\", 'WOW a comb that is truly smooth and seam-free, does not snag my long wavy hair, and smells nice.  Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  It seems very sturdily made, but I am going to buy another just in case.

The colors are bold and beautiful; and a really fun change to my routine for not a lot of money. I found that colors blend out easily and last all day too. I honestly couldn't think of one bad thing to say about this set other than that my palette didn't come sealed. Cosmetic products should always be sealed in my opinion, so I had to deduct a star.

Tried wiping the wand completely off and it still made a mess.\", \"I'm mad I didn't buy this kind of mask sooner, but maybe I was hoping the madness would stop. Here we are a year later. These are so so thin, very soft, and very breathable. I just ordered more colors for me and my kid. I only wear masks when forced and it kills me that my kid has to wear one all day at school. Usually I cut the extra layers out of the cotton ones, but it is still too hot and makes me feel like I'm smothering. These are great. Highly recommend.\", 'My Husband Loves it... firm bristles soothes his scalp', 'I like this because it is small compact and easy to use', 'It\\'s fantastic -  if your deodorant \"stops working\" - give this a try!  It\\'s thick and a little tough to apply BUT it works!  It works for women, men and stinky teenage guys!  The name is funny - bonus!', 'Super cute. It’s just a thin shower cap made of plastic but I use it work work as a nurse. Got lots of compliments on it.', 'These are pretty nice but pretty sparse. If you’re doing a natural look they work great, not for glam.', 'I got this little dish for doing my nails and for working with paint. It’s a great size, the lid is nice at blocking fumes and it seems like it wouldn’t break if dropped on carpet.', 'Extremely disappointed the bottle is damaged, and doesn’t stand up it wobbles', 'Thank you for thinking of this.', 'It’s a necessary cleaning product when your groomer.<br />I haven’t had a chance to use it but I’m sure it’s fine', 'These nail files are really made well - are comfortable to hold, and have almost limitless buffing grit.  They’re double-sided.  It’s great to have a supply of these for the purse, bathroom and in baskets  we keep In both the kitchen and living room in case we need one!  Purple color is pretty - makes them easy to find in the purse!  Good choice!', 'I wondered how my older teeth would take to this - would it be too strong, and wipe out all my fillings!  Actually, it has become a necessary part of my dental care - it removes “stuff” a toothbrush could never dislodge - and is a much more pleasant way to have a really clean mouth without the gyrations of dental floss.  Just so much easier to use than dental floss - and you get a better result.  Very pleased with this.  Haven’t traveled with it - I pack light for long weekends.', 'This grandma had no idea how popular these items are.  My granddaughter (28) was overjoyed to receive one, so evidently they are the newest item in the fight against wrinkles.  She knew all about them, how to use them and what results one expects after a period of use.  This makes a great gift for ladies of 16 or older!', 'Works smoothly and makes the face and neck feel like it’s had a facial!  That stimulation does give the skin a healthy glow, and makes you feel really clean.  Have been using it for two weeks - a couple times a week, and there is a difference in the softness of my aging skin.  No more dry skin flakes - so it’s exfoliating and exposing fresh-looking skin.  Never had one before - but now, I’m a fan!', \"This is a great hair mask that helps protect your color treated hair. It contains some good ingredients that will nourish and hydrate your hair. It comes in a cute little jar and smells fantastic.<br /><br />The mask works very well. It doesn't change your hair color but enhances the life of your color and makes your hair look fantastic. It also helps prevent fading to some degree and makes my colored hair last longer. All in all very happy with this hair mask and I use this about once every week to 10 days.\", \"We all know about this issue so I figured I would give it a shot, why not right? Well sadly I was not too impressed to be honest. My rear was nicely moisturized for sure but I didn't really see any improvement in regards to acne and blackheads to be honest. It was worth a shot though but it does work quite nicely as a moisturizer but there are other, cheaper products for that that I like better tbh. At least it wasn't greasy so you could go on your merry day right away.\", 'MORe di Croatia makes some very nice products. This eye cream comes in a beautiful little frosted glass jar. It has a lovely fragrance that I for one really like a lot.<br /><br />The cream itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. I find that it leaves no residue on the skin behind and makes the skin feel very soft and moisturized. The skin looks great and feels amazing. At $20 this is a good price as well. I can only recommend this one since it seems to help reduce under eye puffiness, not so much the dark circles though but I do like how my skin looks overall.', \"This is a great little starter kit to do your own nails at home. It is a dip powder kit that is very easy to use and has everything you need to do your own nails. You don't even need an LED lamp to do your nails.<br /><br />It has amazing colors that I really like and is perfect for those who want to do their own nails. All in all really happy with this.\", 'This is a nice lip scrub by Simply Dana. It tastes of coconut which I personally really like. It works very well helping to exfoliate the lips in a gentle manner.<br /><br />Especially in the winter my lips are rougher shape and need a little extra help and this gets the job done.', \"This Glam Pearl Serum is very nice but does not come cheap. It comes in a beautiful bottle with a pump dispenser on the top. This allows you to dispense the small quantities you need, which is great since you don't want to waste this product.<br /><br />The serum itself is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves no residue behind on the skin and leaves the skin soft and smooth. I find that the skin has a healthy glow to it and looks great. All in all I really like this.\", 'This face serum by Carla comes in a beautiful glass bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top. It is a dual serum so make sure you mix it well before you dispense it since it tends to separate.<br /><br />It has a gel like consistency almost and is lightweight. It absorbs quickly but the skin does feel a bit sticky after it is applied. That feeling fades after about 5 to 10 minutes or so. Once it is faded the skin feels soft, smooth and looks great. All in all a great product.', 'I admit it, I just love hair products by ikoo. For some reason these just really work for my hair.<br /><br />This one is a travel sized conditioner for fine, thin or flat hair and my hair really takes to it. I find it sad though that for this little one they are charging so much. You are much better of getting the regular size and putting that in a travel size container yourself.<br /><br />The conditioner itself smells amazing and I for one really love that. It is smooth and I let it usually work on my hair for like 3 to 5 minutes. The conditioner rinses out with ease and leaves my hair nice and soft. I find that my hair looks fantastic. It is nice and shiny, and it definitely gets a boost in volume, and just has a healthy look and feel to it.', 'This lotion is great. You get 4 smaller sized squeeze bottles of lavender fragranced hand and body lotion. It smells absolutely amazing first off which is one of the reasons these always come with me when I go somehwere. The second reason is they work. When I use them my skin feels fantastic. The lotion is creamy but lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin making my skin feel soft and hydrated. Very happy and for that price there really are no complaints.', \"This sugar body scrub is amazing. It has an amazing fragrance which is what you will notice first when you open the jar. The scrub is a gentle exfoliator and works very well. It moisturizes as you go along and makes your skin feel soft and smooth. It does have oil in it so that is what makes your skin feel moisturized and you may feel greasy, my recommendation, don't use a ton of it when you use it and start with just a little bit which goes a long way.\", 'This under eye cream comes in a cute little container that looks fantastic. It has retiniol in it that really is great for your skin as well as hyaluronic acid, both that should help with wrinkles. Just a reminder, products with retinol make you more sensitive to sun light so make sure you use sun blockers when using these kinds of products.<br /><br />The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves no residue behind and your skin just feels soft and smooth. The cream has a lovely fragrance that I really like.<br /><br />All in all this is a great find.', \"This is a lovely sleeping mask that comes in a stunning looking jar. As the name implies it is applied at night so it can do its magic. Inside this jar is a creamy mask that smells amazing and I for one really like this. The mask is on the medium weight side but still absorbs pretty quickly into the skin which is great.<br /><br />The skin definitely feels a bit sticky when you apply this mask to your skin but this is common with sleeping masks. I have a couple who don't but this one does and it is not a big deal since you apply it before you head to bed. The next morning you will love the results. The skin feels soft, smooth and looks radiant. I for one am a fan and happy with the results I can get.\", 'This is a very nice serum. It has sedum extract in it which is supposed to help adding hydration to the skin, which in turn adds firmness and elasticity. It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. I for one do like it quite a bit. This is more like a toner and you use it quite similarly to one. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels a tad sticky at first but that quickly goes away. My skin does feel nicely moisturized when I use this so I do like this quite a bit. This is a lovely product.', \"This is a nice intimate wash for women. It is free of alcohol, sulfate and parabens which is great since you don't want those ingredients in there. It is also vegan and plant based which is great. It produces a nice gentle lather that works well and I found I don't need much when I  use it. They made sure that it maintains the natural pH of the skin so you are not prone to infections.<br /><br />The fragrance is ok in my eyes and it works well overall. The price is a bit on the more expensive side considering how much product you get, however considering that it is vegan and all, I think it kind of makes up for it. I am not upset with this product and mine was not expired yet but close, but these types of products can be used at least 3 years past that date so I have no issues with that as well.\", 'This is an interesting product for sure. You get a jar with cream that looks very cute in my eyes but that is not all. You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well. All in all very happy with this and it makes for a fantastic gift!', 'I really like products by Huxley. They tend to be not overpriced and the quality that I found to date is always very good. They always come in packaging that is stylish and looks good.<br />this clay mask is just along the lines and I for one even though clay masks tend to dry out my skin, really like this one.<br /><br />It looks great and this one smells fantastic, one of the things I really like about Huxley products. This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. I let it get pretty dry before I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My skin felt great and was nice and soft after I used this mask. I for one can only recommend this one.', \"This is an interesting kind of cream. The jar it comes in is very cute. It is a frosted glass jar with some cute print on it that just looks really cute to be honest and I like displaying it in my bathroom. Inside this jar you find a very interesting cream, a water gel cream that I haven't really come across yet and really have to say is neat and interesting. I love using this especially on a hot summer day because it is very refreshing. It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin. It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should. I use this in the evening and like how my skin looks and feels in the morning. All in all very happy and this is one of the ones I see myself reaching for more often than not.\", 'In this jar you get 30 pairs of marine algae eye patches. The jar is quite pretty and will look good in any bathroom. The eye patches smell great and are rather soothing to be honest. However I have to say paying $24, much cheaper than their green tea version.<br /><br />These work quite nicely and I do really like them. I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer. These feel even better if you keep them in the fridge, they then have an even more cooling effect.<br /><br />All in all I do really like them, so I will get these instead of their green tea ones from now on.', \"This is a nice serum by Easydew that comes in a dropper bottle. In it is a DW-EGF protein. It is basically a youth protein that helps your skin with collagen and elastin, basically helps your skin stay soft, smooth, and just look great.<br /><br />This serum is a light to medium consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any kind of residue on the skin, it is maybe a bit tacky at first but that goes away quickly. I am not prone to reactions to these kinds of products and didn't have any in this case either.<br /><br />I found this was a great moisturizer and my skin looked soft and smooth overall. This is a nice product and I am satisfied overall. It is also reasonably priced at just $30.\", 'This is a fantastic pack of 12 face masks. You get 2 beauty boosters, 2 best self forward, 2 fresh start, 2 girl’s night in, 2 character face masks and 2 sit back & relax masks. Each has some different ingredients but you will find something that fits what your face is in need of from soothing and calming to helping with inflammation to moisturizing and more. The masks have mild yet pleasant fragrances. The masks themselves are soft and fit very well. This gift set is just $16 so just over a $1 a mask, a great deal really.', 'This is a pretty nice shampoo. You get a massive bottle of this shampoo that comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser on the top, which personally I prefer since it makes it so much easier to use in the shower especially. The shampoo itself smells very nice, which is a big plus in my eyes.<br /><br />It lathers up very nice and cleanses your with ease. Once you are done the shampoo rinses out quite quickly without any issues. The hair feels nice and clean and I for one am quite happy. This is a pretty good deal and I for one am happy with this.', 'I have another blackhead remover but that one did not have the camera adapter. I wanted to actually see the details so this one seemed cool so why not? It is very easy to use and I have to say seeing on the phone what was happening was neat. The blackhead remove is very easy to use, similar to the one I already have really. It has different sized heads that allow you to change the pressure that you are applying. The power button turns it on and off but also changes the modes from soft to normal to strong.<br /><br />Make sure you keep it moving or the vacuum can actually cause damage, meaning break some capillaries which will cause a bruise. This will obviously heal but who wants a bruise in the face?<br /><br />I really like this because you can really see what is going on up close. It is easy to use and works well. The price is reasonable and the pairing with the phone (Samsung S20+) worked well.', 'This is a neat little curling iron that does the work for you really. I have tried some different types of curling irons over the year and wanted something easy and simple to use. My hair is quite long these days and when you have longer hair it gets a little bit more complicated I found. So I wanted to give this one a chance and see how it goes. There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use. I had no issues with my long hair because it has the long barrel to accommodate all my hair and actually curl it all. All in all I am quite happy with this.', 'This brush fits nicely into the hand but I find that the bristles are pretty soft. If you have a tangled beard this will struggle a bit to get through it to be honest. Also if you have a coarse beard this also may struggle quite a bit. For shorter beards this will work quite well. All in all I find it is overpriced for what you are getting and find it just to be average.', 'This is a nice cream by Simply Dana. It comes in a simple yet elegant glass jar. The cream itself has a pleasant but mild fragrance. The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this. It looks nice and just feels moisturized. All in all for a lower priced cream this is not a bad choice.', 'These crayon eyeshadow sticks are interesting. It definitely takes a little getting used to, to work with them but once you get the hang of them they are a nice way to add color to your eye lids.<br /><br />On one side they have the color crayons and on the other side you have a little brush that helps you work in the eye color. In this set you get 6 beautiful colors in the purple scheme which is great. The colors are pretty rich in pigment and they blend quite nicely. All in all I am quite happy with this and for $12 this is not a bad price at all. It is an easy way to create an eye look with just one or two of these.', 'I admit, I am a fan of Maelys products. They just know how to do cosmetics right. This Neck & Decollete Firming Cream is fantastic. It comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar that looks great on every bathroom shelf. Inside of it is this amazing smelling firming cream that you will be thankful you got.<br /><br />This cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. Once it is absorbed it leaves no residue behind. Instead the skin just feels soft and smooth. My skin feels and looks amazing, exactly what I am asking a product like this to do. I for one am sold and I love this cream, one of the ones I tend to reach for.', 'In this pack you get 7 masks for just over $42, so these run you for over $6 a masks. These are on the more expensive side of the spectrum but not yet the most expensive ones I have tried. This is an interesting set of masks that provides you with 6 different types of masks and a double for the hydrating type. You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.', 'In this pack you get 3 masks for $18, so this is one on the more expensive face sheet masks that I have tried. I like that it is biodegradable since we really should do more for our environment so I find this to me a big plus. This mask has some very nice ingredients in it like Vitamin C that is from pineapple and others. It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot. My face felt nicely moisturized when I used this mask and looked great. All in all this is a great mask I just wish it was not as expensive to be honest since it is not on the cheap sice to be used weekly.', 'In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are gold, silver and black and just beautiful. The hair ties are a plain black. These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did. I have long, but thin hair, thin in density and thin in thickness and this hair clip worked just fine. I had no issues gathering just a section or the entire hair together. Even though the clips are flat in the front I had no issues at all working with these, they are actually quite easy to work with and fit quite comfortably in the hair. The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it. They are cute and lovely and the price is not excessive, they are actually inexpensive if you ask me.', 'In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are light blue, a copper and a brown and just beautiful. The hair ties are a light brown, kind of not a great color to be honest but oh well didn’t get these clips for the ties.<br /><br />These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did.

The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it. They are cute and lovely and the price is not excessive, they are actually inexpensive if you ask me.', 'This facial cream comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar. When you open the jar, the cream inside of it is not one of those lotion types but more a butter type of cream, very solid and almost waxy. Don’t be alarmed it did not go rancid or bad, that is just how this cream is. You will scoop some of it out and will notice it actually smells pretty good. With the heat of your skin it also starts to liquify somewhat and makes it easier to apply to your skin.<br /><br />At this point it absorbs pretty easily and quickly into the skin. There were no issues there at all. I for one really liked this cream and it absorbs fully without leaving any residue behind on the skin. The skin actually feels soft and smooth and smells great, sadly only for a few minutes though since the fragrance does fade fairly quickly, but the softness stays. My skin felt moisturized and was rather happy. All in all this is a great little find.', 'Fountain of Truth has some interesting products, some I have liked and others that I was just not convinced of. I am happy to say that this one is definitely worth the money. It comes in a tall small applicator with little metal ball applicators. You have to push the top down to expel the product on the top, right by the little metal eye rollers. The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case. This cream absorbs quickly, I do use my fingers in the end to make sure everything is fully absorbed, but it does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin. This stays for some time so I would recommend using this in the evening because of that.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice product. Yes it is not cheap but this should last you a very long time to be honest since you really don’t need much at all every time you use this.', 'I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.', 'You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal', 'This set of lipsticks is such a gimmick but man I really like them. They are meant to look like a box of cigarettes and the 4 lipsticks are actually pretty small, also meant to look like little cigarettes. This set of 4 will run you about $10 which is not a bad deal to be honest.<br /><br />The little bullet style lipsticks all have very similar tones to be honest but are just different enough that you can distinguish them. They are very easy to apply and you can get a nice pointy application with them which is great. They are surprisingly smooth and creamy and have a good taste to them. They have a pretty good staying power, again it was a bit surprising to be honest. They wear not bad in the waterproof department but did wear off a bit on cups and mugs.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed by these and think these would make for a great little gag gift, especially for young adults dabbling into makeup but also for others as well that are looking for a lipstick that goes well into the purse and gives them options.', 'I really wanted to like this facial serum. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is common for this kind of product. The serum is a prickly pear oil that is supposed to be very good for your face.<br /><br />When you use it you will first notice the fragrance of the oil. I am not sure if maybe my bottle went bad, but mine just smelled very bad, almost like oil that went rancid. I really didn’t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time. I would not recommend using this during the day. Especially when wearing a mask, using a facial oil that leaves an oily residue makes my face very hot and sweaty, just awful and this one would do exactly that. Sadly this one is just average at best and I will not be re-purchasing when I run out.', 'When I received this leave-in conditioner I was a bit confused. I expected to receive a pump dispenser but when I got the product it was in a jar. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since I do prefer the pump dispenser but oh well, just wish they would actually show the real product to be honest. The leave-in conditioner itself smells fantastic so that is a huge plus.<br /><br />When you then dip into the jar to get some of the conditioner out, it is actually pretty thin and runny, which was quite a surprise to me to be honest. Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier. I found that this conditioner left a residue on my hair that I did not care for. It also weighed my hair down that just was undesirable as well. I for one am not a huge fan of this one and can’t recommend this conditioner, I just don’t like it sadly because my hair just didn’t look good, nor felt great. At least it is not expensive and it may work for others but this just didn’t work for me at all.', 'Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.', 'This shampoo by Mr. Zaranda was just average in my eyes. I had higher hopes for it but it is what it is. It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.<br /><br />Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.', 'I am quickly becoming a fan of products from EasyDew. This cleanser comes in a very nice pump dispenser. When you use it you will first notice that it has a lotion like consistency which is unusual for cleansers. Next you will notice the incredible fragrance it has that I absolutely love, especially for facial products fragrances are very important to me and this one is fantastic.<br /><br />This cleanser is super gentle I found. After I am done my skin feels soft and smooth and not dried out at all. It actually feels almost like I moisturized it. I do still follow up with a moisturizer but you could do without one if you were in a rush.', 'This is a very nice sheet face mask. When you open the package the mask is loaded with the mask which is nice, but it is not dripping which you don’t want. You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin. In this box, that btw is perfect as a gift as well, you get 10 masks for just $24, which I think is a very good price and allows you to do something good for your skin for some time.', 'This intensive moisturizer by Easydew is a very nice cream and runs you $45. I would still consider this a mid-range priced product for the quantity you are getting. It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn’t want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product. To achieve all this you really don’t need that much of the product either which is great because it is not the cheapest product, however also not the most expensive either. All in all I do really like this but only like using this in the evening.', 'This is a nice inexpensive body wash. It comes in very nice packaging to be honest and makes for a great gift, especially with the holidays coming up. They also have the matching body lotion and all. The body wash comes in a generous bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top that makes it very easy to use especially when you are in the shower.<br /><br />The body wash has a nice fragrance that is very pleasant. It does linger while you are in the shower but once you are all rinsed off, sadly it doesn’t last too long after that. The body wash does produce a decent lather but sadly it is not too luxurious. All in all for the price that you are paying, which is less than $15, this is a pretty nice find.', 'This FillUp by EasyDew is a great cream that I personally really like a lot. First of it comes in a stunning squeeze tube that has a one of those interesting tips for a more concentrated spot application. This pretty silver tube will look great on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive less than $25 so for me this one is a winner.', 'I really like this retinol serum by Simple Elegance. It comes in a classic looking pump dispenser. Keep in mind, when you use products containing retinol, your skin is more sensitive to sun light so make sure to use sun protection when you go outside.<br /><br />This serum smells amazing and I for one really like that a lot about this product. The serum itself is almost like a cream and very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves hardly any residue behind, and what it does pretty much disappears quickly. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive at $30 so for me this one is a winner.', 'This is a nice facial emulsion. It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works well to dispense the small quantities you need for your face. It has a mild yet pleasant fragrance. The emulsion itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin.<br /><br />At first the face was a bit sticky and I was not crazy about how my face felt. But that changed rather quickly and I was impressed on how my face felt. It felt smooth and soft and just looked nicely moisturized. I for one really liked how this emulsion makes my face feel. This is not bad for an inexpensive facial emulsion. Pretty pleased with this actually.', 'This is a nice toner. It comes in a nice tall bottle. It doesn’t have some kind of dispensation mode, just a little whole that you pour the toner out from. It is easiest to use cotton pads to use this toner with so that seems to work the best.<br /><br />The toner has a mild but pleasant fragrance. That scent does not linger though. It seems that this toner is very mild. I have had no reactions to it. It felt moisturizing and did not dry out my skin. I do find this to be maybe a bit overpriced though to be honest at $31.', 'This is a nice inexpensive body wash. It comes in very nice packaging to be honest and makes for a great gift, especially with the holidays coming up. They also have the matching body lotion and all. The body wash comes in a generous bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top that makes it very easy to use especially when you are in the shower.<br /><br />The body wash has a nice musky fragrance that is very pleasant. It does linger while you are in the shower but once you are all rinsed off, sadly it doesn’t last too long after that. The body wash does produce a decent lather but sadly it is not too luxurious. All in all for the price that you are paying, which is less than $15, this is a pretty nice find.', 'his is a nice moisturizer for men but in my eyes could also be used for women. It is pretty much fragrance free which makes it great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. It comes in a very classic black squeeze tube. This moisturizer is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. There is no residue left behind on the skin either which is great. The skin feels nicely moisturized which is exactly as it should. This is also not an expensive product which makes it perfect.', 'This is an above average moisturizer by Black Wolf. You get a fairly small white squeeze bottle that contains the moisturizer. You don’t need a lot of the product when you use it. It has a very nice and lovely fragrance that I do like and is fairly gender neutral, but I think it is definitely more appropriate for men than women.<br /><br />The moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave a greasy feeling on the skin though that takes some time to dissipate. Because of that I would recommend this for evening use. It is very moisturizing though so I am happy with that. My skin did look and feel great once the product was completely absorbed into the skin and the sticky feeling was gone. It is fairly inexpensive at just below $20.', 'I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Luminous Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other brighteners that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.', 'I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle.

This particular blend is supposed to help protect your skin against environmental stressors and resulting in youthful looking skin while hydrating it. When you use this you will notice this serum it has the most pleasant fragrance of the 4 that I have and is actually pleasant and not as reminiscent of an essential oil as the others are.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin. When I use this my skin feels nice and soft, very smooth and definitely looks beautifully hydrated, thanks hyaluronic acid.  Is this really worth the price?

The box that it comes in is rather beautiful and the bottle itself is also very classy looking. The bottle itself is a pump dispenser. I usually use a cotton pad when I apply a toner but for this one I just used my fingers instead. The toner is a liquid formula that is on the thicker side with a hint of gel in it almost.<br /><br />This toner contains polyphenols which are actually micro nutrients and good for you, I know it sounds bad so I had to look it up. It also contains sea buckthorn fruit oil that helps brighten the skin complexion and recover from skin fatigue. It contains lily flower extract that helps moisturize the skin and nourish the skin and cherry on top, it contains no parabens.<br /><br />So now when you use it, you notice it has an interesting consistency, somewhat between watery and gel like and it bubbles when you dispense it. It has a very pleasant scent that I really like a lot and this fragrance lingers quite a bit which I am all in favor of. I feel that it nicely moisturized my skin. It didn’t irritate my skin or anything and worked nicely for me. All in all I am very happy with this toner.', 'This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.', 'I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn’t impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.', 'This is a fantastic Leave-in hair serum. It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it. You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can’t say enough good things about this!', 'This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.', 'In this box you get a set of 12 lipsticks. These are supposed to be matte lipsticks but I found they are borderline matte to satin lipsticks really. These will only run you about $10 so definitely on the cheap side. Each lipstick comes in a little plastic container that has a Halloween themed print on it. They are fairly cheap but again, getting 12 lipsticks for $10 I don’t have high expectations.<br /><br />I found there is some range in colors but not a big one. There are some darker colors and some lighter colors and then the rest all was somewhat similar. I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren’t really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don’t feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don’t taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.', \"We have now all been dealing with COVID for some time now and sadly have gotten used to wearing masks. At work I have to wear these types of surgical face masks as part of our PPE in the lab. When I saw these for this price I figured it was worth getting to have some disposable ones around. I have some cloth masks but they should be washed and when I forget or they are in the wash it is nice to have a back up.<br /><br />You get this convenient box with 50 disposable masks in it. I really like that you get this in a box so they are easy to use. In the box you get 5 bags of 10 masks each which is great. So you can actually take one of these bags and keep them where you need them, very convenient.  These are similar to the ones we use at work and these work. These fit well and are comfortable. They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now. They do have the little metal clip on the nose so you can make them fit properly which a lot of people don't usually do for some odd reason, but especially if you have glasses you really should take advantage of that. The loops around the ears were plenty big so no complaints there.\", 'I really like this shampoo by Giovanni. I was not sure what to expect to be honest, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of time when these shampoos contain tea tree and hemp their fragrance is not the greatest, but this one was shockingly impressive and really good. The fragrance of this one was actually really good and you can barely smell the tea tree which is great. I only smelled hints of it while it was on my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo produces a nice lather that wasn’t too rich but plenty to get my hair nice and clean. I didn’t feel like I needed a lot of it to get my hair nice and clean. I did let it sit for a couple of minutes to let it do “its thing”.  It rinsed out very easily and left nothing behind in my hair. My hair felt nice and clean and looked great. I followed up with a leave-in conditioner afterward still but my hair could have handled not using one after this shampoo. All in all I am very happy with this one and can recommend it.', 'I have used a few products by Follain to this date so I was curious to see how this mattifying moisturizer would perform. It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.', 'This is a nice baby bath oil by Emilia. I like that it has organic ingredients since babies tend to be more sensitive still. It is itch-free and hypoallergenic as well. It also has oatmeal extract in it which is known to be soothing.<br /><br />It has a pleasant scent reminiscent of clean baby in my eyes. When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself. It just makes my skin feel great and look fantastic.', 'This is the first natural deodorant that has actually worked for me. It contains no aluminum or any other other \"chemical\" ingredients. It is baking soda and some other natural ingredients and I have to say this one actually works.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant fragrance of lavender that I really like and is the reason I choose this one in particular. That fragrance lingers for quite some time. It works very well protecting from sweat and odor. I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually worked. The price for this is reasonable and in line with another leading natural aluminum free deodorant.', 'This is a very nice shampoo. You get a huge bottle for just $16 containing argan oil which is great for your hair. I like that this bottle has a pump dispenser which makes it just so much easier to dispense the shampoo in the shower.<br /><br />The shampoo has a very pleasant scent that I like a lot. It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos. It rinses out very easily and leaves you with squeaky clean hair. My hair looked good when I used this and I have no complaints there. All in all this is a very nice inexpensive shampoo containing argan oil which I do like for my hair.', \"I was a bit surprised how small the bottle of shampoo was since it costs almost $20. But I admit the shampoo itself is very nice. First of you will notice how fantastic it smells. It produces a very nice lather that distributes beautifully throughout your hair. I let it sit in for a little bit since it is supposed to help you with your hair, making it thicker and richer.<br /><br />It rinses out with ease leaving your hair squeaky clean. I do follow it with a conditioner but overall my hair did look and feel fantastic when I use this shampoo. When you use it you don't need a lot of it so thankfully this bottle should last you a good amount.\", \"This is a very nice facial massager that I really like. It comes with 2 different rollers for your face. This one actually can be battery powered if you are so inclined. The rose quartz rollers are very cooling on your face and you could actually remove the heads, since I wouldn't put the electric part in the fridge, you can put the heads alone in the fridge for extra cooling. This will amplify the effects of this massager and help massage away the puffiness in your face.<br /><br />This is one fantastic find and for just $21, you can find some for a little less than that but I really like the design of this one. This helps on those really tough mornings to massage away the puffiness and help your face shed of some years. Perfect for a gift as well.\", \"I really like products from L'ange. This leave in conditioner is no different. It is not cheap at $22 since the bottle is fairly small but the product in it is very good and you don't need a whole lot of it so that does make up for it.<br /><br />This leave in detantler comes in a nice mister bottle. The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a great product to you use for your hair. When dry my hair is still very manageable and looks great. I really like this a lot and what it does to my hair.\", 'This i a very nice inexpensive soothing cream by I Woke Up Like This. It comes in a cute little jar. You get a little spatula with it that allows you to keep the cream nice and untainted and clean.<br /><br />The cream itself smells absolutely fantastic. I really like the fragrance of this one a lot.  The texture of this one is perfect for soothing. It is not really a cream but a combination of cream and gel. It feels fantastic on your skin and if you keep this chilled it will feel even better yet, especially if your skin is irritated by the sun. I found this works for all kinds of irritations really and really like how my skin feels when I use this.<br /><br />It is very lightweight and absorbs very fast into the skin. There is no residue left behind on my skin when I use this. I am a fan and can only recommend this cream. Your skin will thank you.', 'This is a nice shimmer. You get a fairly generous container with this shimmer. It is best applied with your finger but will work with a brush as long as you wet it either with water or better with a setting spray to be honest. Make sure when you apply it that you put it in place where you want it. Going over it again tends to make a mess of it.<br /><br />The color is beautiful and I do really like that. It is very pigmented so that is good, just really load up and apply because if you go back and forth it just makes a mess and can flake off.', \"This is a very expensive  facial oil at $79. It comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the oil inside from light from degradation. The oil itself is applied using a dropper like most really. It is completely scentless which is disappointing but will work well for people sensitive to scents.<br /><br />They claim that it will not leave you with a greasy after feel, well I am not sure what they are talking about. It absorbs quickly but I definitely had a greasy residue on my skin and that stuck with me. I would recommend using this in the evenings only because of this. You wouldn't want to wear a face mask with this greasy feel on your face. You already sweat a lot in those masks and this would make you feel even worse in them. As an overnight moisturizing treatment this does work well though.<br /><br />But would I repurchase at this price? No way, there are other much nice products out there especially at that price.\", 'I have a few products by Higher Education and like the majority of them. This clay mask is fantastic. It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.', 'This facial serum by Dr. Denese is one of the best serums I have used in some time. It comes in a stunning looking dropper bottle. Sadly it does not have a scent but I will look past that. It is also not a cheap serum to be honest but I think this one is worth it.<br /><br />The serum has an oil like consistency and is clear. With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very lightweight and it absorbs very quickly into your face and just literally disappears into your skin. It leaves absolutely no residue behind which is odd because it has a real oil like consistency so I expected an oily residue on my skin. Instead I was left with super soft and smooth skin that just felt and looked fantastic. And that is why I just really like this so much.', 'This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.', \"This is a nice facial creme. It does come in a jar which is not my favorite container for facial product because it is not the most hygienic but you can make it work.<br /><br />The cream itself has a nice scent to it that I do like but it does not linger at all. The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. I found that my face had a slight residue but after about 10 minutes that did fade away and I was left with nice and soft skin.<br /><br />As I said I like this facial skin overall and I had no reactions to it. I have normal skin and don't expect any issues in general though. It is a bit expensive and for that I would have expected a slightly better container than this cheap plastic it comes in.\", 'This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.', \"This is a pretty nice mascara. It comes in a very nice container that looks great. The wand is a very thin and long wand that makes it easy to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy. All in all this is a good one, great for length but no real improvement in regards to thickness.\", \"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. Last year when I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are a gorgeous minty green. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $13 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten to date so not sure if that is worth it but these are nice and sturdy and made well.\", \"This is a fantastic cleanser by Higher Education. It comes in a very nice squeeze tube that is nice and simple but has a very clean design in line with this product line. The cleanser smells fantastic very refreshing and really amazing, one of my favorites that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser does not produce a heavy lather but I don't really need that. It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is a fantastic cleanser that feels great on the skin and smells amazing, everything I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture.\", 'I just love these Sigma Lipsticks! In this set you get 4 unique lipsticks that are all in the same color family but the colors are different enough that you actually get 4 different lipsticks and it is worth getting this set for a whopping $75! The colors are 2 beautiful earthy nudes, one more pinky nude and one stunning red tone that is just plain perfect! This is a gorgeous set in regards to colors.<br /><br />Now the applicators are so unique and different and stunning on their own. They also have a magnetic closure of sorts because when you close them they kind of pull shut at the very end so they must have a magnetic closure in it.<br /><br />The lipstick themselves are super creamy and feel amazing on the lips. They have a pleasant taste to them and are just amazing. There is nothing but greatness about them and these are worthy of the name Sigma! I love everything about these and can only recommend this set. Perfect to give as a gift or purchase and breakup and give individual ones as a gift since each are packaged in a box.', 'This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn\\'t work as well. The pads didn\\'t have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn\\'t as many bubbles as I would have expected from a \"bubble pad\" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn\\'t dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn\\'t too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.', 'I really like this eye liner. It is not too expensive. It is a nice liquid eye liner that has a nice fine tip. It is easy to use and applies nice and evenly. You could get a wing done with this one without trouble if you have a steady hand because the tip is nice and fine.<br /><br />I have had no issue with smudging with this one which is nice. It is a very nice dark ebony color that looks great. I have gotten some compliments when I have used this because it just makes your eyes look great. It is easy to remove so no problems there.', \"Oh my, now this is a very nice moisturizer by Higher Education. Even though I am not a fan of skin products coming in jars, this jar is just plain beautiful. This gold digger moisturizer smells amazing and I can't really figure out what it is, but it is the mix of cucumber and melon which is always a winning combination. It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while. So even though it is not the cheapest cream around you still get your money's worth. I like this one, quite a bit and can only recommend it.\", 'This is a nice Retinol cream that is a little expensive considering it contains only 0.5% retinol. I have others that contain 3 times as much and cost half of this one. One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get. My skin does like it though and with the lower concentration of the retinol this may work better for people who are more sensitive to retinol.', 'This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue. So for paying less than $10 this palette is well worth it in my eyes.', \"I am so torn about this oil. It comes in a glass dropper bottle like most oils come, mostly to protect the oil. Make sure you mix it well since the gold settles on the bottom of it, yes it has actual gold flecks in it. Besides the actual 24k gold it has all natural ingredients making this an actual edible oil. You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.\", \"This is a very nice eye shadow palette. In it you get 2 cool brown shades that are mattes and one shimmer and one glitter shade. They are very nice colors and all go very well together so you really don't have to think hard to get a look that looks fantastic with this 4 color palette. The mattes blend easily and look great. Even a beginner should have no issue with these. I used them with and without a primer and they had fantastic staying power so no complaints there either.<br /><br />The shimmer and glitter were fantastic to make the look standout. Either one works for whatever occasion you have in mind, shimmer for day to day wear and glitter for a more evening wear in my eyes.<br /><br />At almost $30 for 4 colors this is a bit more on the expensive side since I have gotten some fantastic inexpensive palettes for less with a lot more colors but this is a very nice palette and great for travel really.\", \"I wasn't sure what to expect but I am a REAL fan of this deep emulsion. It comes in a cute little bottle that has a little pump dispenser on the top. The emulsion smells incredible and is one of my favorites really. It is super lightweight and feels very cooling when you use it so I really like to use this one when I saw a lot of sun during the day because it just feels fantastic and on top of that also smells great.<br /><br />The emulsion absorbs very quickly into your skin and your skin feels amazingly soft. I found my skin looked great as well so this one in my eyes really ticked all the boxes. I felt there was no residue left on my skin either. I for one am a fan and can only recommend this one and the price is not bad at all at less than $30. I might have to check into more of their products. Thankfully it came with lots of samples that I will try and probably end up getting more, oh the hardship.\", \"I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.\", \"The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.\", \"I really like this Tone Up Cream. It is a great little moisturizer that I like to use during the day a lot. It adds a nice little glow I find to my skin that just gives it a little extra. I don't like to wear foundation every day but instead like to wear tinted kind of products on occasion, just a little bit of something. This one is along those lines just a step back I think since it only adds a bit of glow really while giving a lot of moisture to your skin which it really needs right now. With wearing masks a lot my face is suffering and this really helps countering those effects.<br /><br />This moisturizer comes in a cute little squeeze tube that I do like. It smells very nice, a scent I can't pin point but is very lovely.\", 'This is a pretty nice face oil. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is pretty cute. I admit it smells like an essential oil and contains lavender, cypress and sweet orange, all scents I like.<br /><br />The oil is not very heavy and absorbs into your skin fairly quickly. It is a quite oily though and takes quite some time to absorb into your skin. But you can expect that from a face oil if you ask me. Unlike another oil from Lua this one stays oily though, not sure why that is. Because of the oil your face is soft though but that is mostly because of that greasiness. Probably after about an hour or two that goes away and your skin is nice and soft.', 'This is a nice set of scrunchies. You get quite a variety of different scrunchies in this. You get some simple ring scrunchies I guess they call them that are my personal favorite, mostly because the colors are absolutely amazing in this trio. Then you get a trio of bunny ear style scrunchies that is also very cute and decorative and lastly a trio of scarf scrunchies that is very decorative as well.<br /><br />In addition you get 7 hair pins to dress up your hair that are very cute. I still have to learn how to use this the right way and make them work in my hair. I have finer hair so these tend to slide out but I know there is a trick to make them stay in place. This is definitely a cute set that is worth getting to dress up your hair.', 'This is an pretty nice face sheet mask in my opinion. In the pack you get 4 masks for about $15, so almost $4 per mask, not the cheapest but also not the most expensive I have used to date.<br /><br />The masks are very easy to use. They come individually wrapped and are folded nicely. The material of these is not the softest I have used but they work. They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy. I would have expected a little better for the price since I have used cheaper masks that were nicer. All in all these are pretty nice though.', \"Sadly I do not care for this True-Aloe cleansing bar. It is a fairly large soap bar I give it that, however I don't care for how it smells at all. The scent of this soap bar is actually sort of off putting to be honest, which is odd considering the ingredients that it has. Also it is kind of weird that it has these weird little bumbs in it, not sure what they are. My skin felt pretty dry when I used it as well so all in all I am not a fan of this.\", \"This kit is fantastic. It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.\", 'I like this moisturizer from MD Complete. It comes in a very nice little pump dispenser that allows you to dispense the small quantities you need from this product.<br /><br />The product smells very nicely of citrus and is very lightweight. This moisturizer absorbs quickly into your skin and feels just fantastic. I really feel like it does a fantastic job in the department of moisturizing your skin. Your skin looks and feels fantastic when you use this product, well at least mine does. I have had no negative reactions when I use this moisturizer.<br /><br />It is reasonably priced and works well in my opinion. Personally I can recommend this.', \"This Vitamin Brightening Ampoule by BE PLAIN is just ok in my eyes. It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.\", 'This is a nice, inexpensive conditioner for your eyelashes and eyebrows. It is very gentle and you can comfortable use it around the eyes. I have had no negative reactions not even teary eyes at any time. This product is very easy to use which is good. So far I noticed a mild increase in regards to eye lashes and my eye brows do look a little fuller. Considering the price point of this product I think it is worth the investment to see if it works for you as well.', 'In this set you get a keratin shampoo and keratin conditioner. Both of them are sulfate free which is great, however when I read the ingredients it turns out that the shampoo actually has silicone in it, not a fan of that. Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.', \"This shampoo is just middle of the road for me. It comes in a bottle that has a little dispense opening on the top, personally I prefer pump dispensers that just make things a lot easier. The bottle itself is actually a bit small, thought it would be bigger especially for the $20 price tag.<br /><br />The smell of it was not bad but also not great. It produced a nice light lather that did a good job cleaning my hair I would say. It didn't feel like it was drying out my hair or anything. I can't say that I noticed any significant improvement on the appearance of my hair in regards of anti thinning. To me it was just a regular shampoo to be honest and for that it was overpriced and the scent not up to par.\", \"This shampoo is just middle of the road for me.

The colors themselves would actually be pretty nice overall, but they disappoint in their application.<br /><br />So first of there are no mattes, so you can only use this for accents when using other eye shadow palettes really to use the shimmers nad glitters in this one. the colors are not bad, except they are not very pigmented at all and you really don't get very good payoff when you use them. And then of course there is the white one with the chunky sequins in it, you should not under any circumstances use this on your eyes, that is just plain dangerous! Use it on your cheeks, your body but not on your eyes, that is just not safe at all!<br /><br />They claim that with this palette you can complete a perfect eye shadow makeup, well no, you can not. There is no matte and no transition shade. There is just no way you can create a look from this palette. Plus I actually tried, they do not blend at all.\", 'Beware, this is a product that is meant for nails with toe fungus and to completely remove those nails and start fresh!<br /><br />They make it sound like it is to strengthen nails that may need some help but once you read the instructions on the box it actually tells you when you use this product that your nail will fall off.<br /><br />It smells pretty horrific. So unless you have severe nail fungus and want your nails to fall off, don\\'t use this. I haven\\'t tried it since that is not what I wanted. When I got this I read the \"renews, restores and dehydrates damaged nails, repairs and protects\" not makes your nails fall of. So with that being said, I will have to pass actually using this product.', \"This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.\", \"This is an interesting serum for your face. The bottle comes in this interesting dropper bottle that only shows the dropper when you unscrew the cap. The serum is a milky kind of solution, so make sure you mix it well before you use it just to make sure it is well mixed.<br /><br />The serum is kind of thick but absorbs quickly into your skin. Your skin stays tacky for about an hour or so. After that it becomes fairly nice and soft.<br /><br />The serum does have a scent to it but I can't describe it. It is fairly nice though so no complaints there. I have had no negative skin reactions or issues when I used this product. This to me is a little over average.\", \"These are nice under eye patch masks. They have a nice mild citrus type of scent, almost like mango so not sure how they can say they are unscented because they are not. I personally really like the scent so that is a plus in my eyes. Also surprised how some reviewers say they are unscented. So confusing.<br /><br />These come with a small pair of plastic tweezers to help you get the little patches out. The patches come in a cute little jar. The patches are thicker, gel like and very nice. I had an issue with them staying in place though. You keep them on for about 10 to 15 minutes or so. By that time they are almost dry so all the active ingredients are mostly in your skin or on by the time you are done. The rest you just let absorb when you remove the patches.<br /><br />The patches are nice and cooling and I really like how they feel on. I just wish they wouldn't slip since they did slip on me a bit. Not a big deal just a little annoyance.\", \"This hair finishing stick works quite well. It comes in a similar tube as your eye mascara does and also has a similar wand to it. The gel is clear and very lightweight. It feels almost like water when you have it on your hair really. It is not sticky or greasy really.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works quite well and the staying power is pretty good as well. It is fairly cheap to so not a big investment there and definitely reasonable. I am not sure how big of an issue it really is though to get something like it. I guess if you are going to a big event and you want everything to be just perfect this is a product for it, but on a day to day basis I wouldn't really bother with it. But it works and it is pretty much scentless, so no issues there at all.\", \"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends.

I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are blue but with a tie dye kind of effect in them, super cute. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $10 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten.\", \"This is an ok face day lotion. It comes in a beautiful pump dispenser however which I personally prefer. It does have some nice ingredients like shea butter and hyaluronic acid.<br /><br />Where it lacks is its scent. It doesn't have a scent that is worth writing home about. I didn't care for it at all and thankfully it doesn't linger on your skin either.<br /><br />When you use this moisturizer it is pretty light but is sticky on your skin when you use it. It does absorb fairly quickly though. My skin just felt ok when I used this. It didn't feel super soft or anything nor did it look anything spectacular. This to me was just a middle of the road kind of moisturizer. Now considering all this and the cost of $63, I just can't recommend this product. I think it is overpriced and for what you get I am just not a fan at all.\", \"In today's age when you are restricted with how much liquids you can bring along on your travels on an airplane, it makes sense to fill these little refillable atomizer bottles with your favorite perfume to bring along so you can have them in your carry on luggage. Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well. These are on the cheaper side but for what they are intended these work perfectly well.\", 'You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH. That does make me wonder what it does to that plastic bottle and if over time it will dissolve that plastic bottle.', \"These reusable makeup remover pads environmentally friendly since you can wash them and reuse them which I prefer, which is awesome. Plus they are just so much nicer on your skin. It comes with 16 bamboo/cotton pads and 5x bamboo/cotton/charcoal pads. These are super soft and for sensitive areas. You also get a little mesh pouch where you can store these pads in and also wash them in the washer. This way you won't loose them. It seems they really thought of everything you could possible need! I have been looking for something like these for some time and this is the perfect set. I wish they would have just made all in darker colors so they don't show the makeup stains at all but it is ok the way it is and I can work with it. Fantastic buy of a high quality product!\", \"This is a gentle facial cleanser that works very well. It doesn't have a pleasant scent I enjoy but it is not horrible. My skin did feel a bit dry after I used this though and I would have wished it would be more hydrating as they promised. I had to follow it up with a nice moisturizer to make sure my skin didn't dry out too much when I use this cleanser. In my eyes this cleanser is just ok. I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall. This cleanser did not hydrate but it did cleanse well and was gentle, so at least it performed along those lines. So for that I gave it a 3 star rating.\", \"This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.\", 'This is a fantastic little gift set. It contains a moisturizing cream and an overnight night mask that both come in beautiful little jars.<br /><br />These smell lovely of rose water. They contain some great ingredients like squalene, retinol, Aloe Vera, shea butter, chamomile, hyaluronic acid, argan oil, collagen and more. This is really a little power house.<br /><br />Both are on the lighter side and absorb quickly into your skin. Your skin looks and feels great when you use these. I really this and this makes for a great gift. The price is also fantastic.', \"This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.\", \"I really wanted to like this but I am just not a fan. It has a very strong menthol scent to it that I just am not big on. I am very sensitive to menthol smells and can't stand it. This one is very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />It does have a refreshing feel to it but the smell of menthol just overpowers everything. My skin was soft when I used it and did not dry out so that is great. So for those who like menthol this is great, but for me this just doesn't work.\", 'These are very nice hair clips. I am impressed on how strong these are. In this pack you get 4 clips for each of the 3 colors, clear, brown and black. I have long hair but on the thinner side and these clips had no issue holding my hair together. I think the key is the design and how they made the teeth.<br /><br />These hair clips are very well made and look great. I am impressed on how good these really are and really like using these.', 'This is a very nice face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face and let sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses. It feeds your skin it feels like with the serum it contains and leaves your skin soft and healthy. Your face will look and feel great. This is a nice little treat for yourself. You will get 10 masks in this pack which is actually a really nice deal.', 'I did not know what to expect with this facial cleansing milk. It comes in this nice bottle. When you dispense it onto your hand you will notice it is a lotion like cleanser. It smells beautifully and is one of my favorite cleansers actually. It is super gentle and really cleanses your face nicely. There is nothing bad about this product really, it smells fantastic, is gentle and does a very nice job cleansing your face. This is a winner all around and my usual go to product.', \"This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.\", \"This hydrating cream by Sustainable Youth is one of their better products in my eyes. It is a pretty heavy cream but it does absorb fairly quickly and fully into your skin. It smells heavily of citrus, so finally one of their products actually smells good. Most of their products I have tried to date either don't have a scent or smell kind of bad. Considering how expensive they are in general that is just not acceptable in my eyes. Thankfully this one actually smells pretty good since it is also pretty expensive.<br /><br />This heavier cream actually leaves behind very soft skin that looks good. I liked how my skin felt. The scent of it does dissipate fairly quickly though but that is ok. All in all this is probably my favorite product in their line. Would I repurchase, probably not because their are products out there as good and better for a similar price or cheaper. But from this line this is their best product in my opinion.\", \"This is a very cute makeup bag. The coloring of it is just gorgeous and the main reason I got it really. The material is super soft. It comes with a hand strap that allows you to quickly grab it. On the inside it has a mash pocket on the side that allows you to keep smaller items secured. It is a pretty decent size that allows you to bring all your makeup on your travels.<br /><br />It came with some beauty blenders that are pretty good. The makeup brushes that came with it however are just plain cheap and in my opinion crap. You can make them work but I personally don't care for them and have better ones, so there is just no time I will really use them. Plus the weird handle they have really doesn't make them very user friendly either. These are just a waste in my eyes and not sure why they even bothered with them.<br /><br />The bag itself however is gorgeous and a win. I actually had a tough time deciding which color to get because they are all so cute!\", 'This is a nice makeup holder with some \"bling\". Apparently I have accumulated too many products over the last few months and was in need of additional storage. This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.', 'This set of lip balm is very nice. It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.', \"This is the third product I have tried by Merlot and I also like this one, so 2 out of 3 is not bad. This serum is packed with peptides, resveratrol and grape seed extract.<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this and what you apply quickly absorbs into your skin. It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.\", \"Now this is a body lotion I can only recommend. It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.\", 'Now this is quite the mascara. First of it comes in this beautiful container, full of bling, so this is for the girly girl of girls. I have to say I was a bit oh my when I saw that since I am not your girly girl. BUT when I used this I was rather impressed. I didn\\'t think it really thickened my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. I didn\\'t apply a ton since I used it during the day and not for a night out in town. It added a good amount of length to be honest and it didn\\'t look fake, it was a \"wet eyelashes\" kind of look that I really liked. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is waterproof and definitely smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this and can only recommend this.', \"This lip balm is just ok in my eyes. It does work and softens your lips. I do like the fact that it has sun protection in it since melanoma is a serious problem in today's age. I would have hoped that with the ingredients of coconut and grape seed that it would have had a flavor of either one in it, but sadly it does not. It was fairly tasteless actually. Nowadays a lot of lip balms are flavored and to be honest that is one of the criteria why I pick certain lip balms.<br /><br />Yes this one works and its staying power is pretty good. It gets points for its sun blocking powers but I am deducting one for the lack of flavor, especially since I used other products from this line that definitely had the flavor/scent of grapes.\", 'This is a very nice eye shadow palette. It comes with a total of 12 eye shadows, including 8 mattes with warm and cold tone browns and 4 shimmers, 2 warm and 2 cold tones there. I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion.', 'This is a fantastic wig! I love the length on this and how the hair curls in on the front. The hair is just plain beautiful. The red color is a beautiful burgundy color which I am a huge fan of. This a great find for anyone looking for a great wig! The hair is nice and soft and just falls like a beautiful little waterfall in the front. I love how it frames my face when I wear this. The ombre effect on it is done to perfection! Fantastic find.', 'These are some nice pairs of false reusable eyelashes. They are easy to use and look great. You get 4 pairs and some tweezers to help applying them. They are made out of faux mink. I like how they make my eyes look and give my eye lashes a nice full look, great for a night out in town. These are comfortable to wear all night long since they are fairly light. I would definitely recommend them for evening use and not for day time use since they have a bit of a dramatic flare to them.', \"This colored hair wax works very well. It is perfect for those Halloween or cosplay occasions. If I would have gotten a different color than gray I guess I could have used it on other occasions for like accent strikes of hairs.<br /><br />It is easy to use and leaves a similar feeling behind as if you used some of those colored hair sprays. The hair is a tad stiff, just like it is when you use hair wax. I don't use those kinds of products often so it is always a bit weird to me when I can't just run my fingers through my long hair.<br /><br />It washes out easily without any problems. When you apply it and wash your hands it comes of easy as well. This is a very easy to use product without any issues and not very expensive so you can't really go wrong with it.\", \"This facial cream comes in a cute little pump dispenser.It is a gentle cream that has a pleasant scent to it that only lingers for a short little time. It quickly absorbs into your skin and leaves a beautiful looking skin behind that is very soft.<br /><br />My skin had no negative reactions to it, no reddening, no rashes, nothing. My skin felt nice and moisturized when using this. I don't really have a lot of dark spots so it is tough to tell if those are lightened when using this cream.\", \"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. It almost felt like a lotion when I used it. So the description that it does NOT lather is 100% accurate. I was a bit confused by that to be honest so yes read the description. It works very well that is true. It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else. So this only gets an ok since it wasn't outstanding in any category really. I had no negative reactions to it and it is super gentle but that is about it.\", 'These wooden brushes are just plain fantastic. The bristles are nice and stiff but not too stiff to hurt you. Stiff enough however to stimulate to provide a good scrub, wet or dry for that matter. You get 2 brushes in this set and one handle that you can put on either brush.<br />One is a nice round brush with nylon bristles that are good for scrubbing your feet that cleanses, softens and smooths the skin. The second brush is an oval brush that just has the stiff boar bristles that helps to exfoliate and smooths the skin.<br /><br />Using these brushes dry helps cleanse your skin but also stimulates your lymphatic system. It promotes blood circulation, helps excrete toxins and relaxes your muscles. Plus it just feels great! You can switch the handle between these two brushes for the one you need it for which is convenient in my eyes. I really like using these and they are just good for you and feel fantastic.', \"This serum contains Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Argireline Peptides, Vitamin E,  Red Marine Algine and some others, all ingredients that are good for your skin and are similar to their face moisturizer. The consistency of the serum is however different and you need a lot less of this product I found. A tiny bit goes a long way!<br /><br />This product comes in cute little pump dispenser that works very well. After I used this product I didn't think my skin felt super soft like it felt after using some other serums in comparison, it felt ok no doubt but not like with some other serums so that was a bit disappointing. I also found this product did not smell very good, similar to their moisturizer. I am not sure what it is about this line. Thankfully that scent does not linger for long.<br /><br />This product is definitely not for me, and I think this line at this point may  not be for me all together since I am striking out at 2 for 2.\", 'This face moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C, plus some other good ingredients is not bad. It also contains glycolic acid, salicyclic acid, Vitamin A and E and really has a lot of good ingredients for your skin. It is lightweight and applies nicely to your skin. This moisturizer absorbs very quickly but your skin doesn\\'t feel super soft after you apply it. Yes it is soft but I have other moisturizer that make my skin feel a lot softer when I use them.<br /><br />It comes in this really cute pump dispenser that is very stylish. What I did not like about this moisturizer is the scent of it. I can\\'t pinpoint what it smells like but I did not particularly care for it. Thankfully the scent does not linger very long on your skin. The other thing I did not understand that in the directions of using it it says \" follow with moisturizer or makeup\". Why would I have to use a moisturizer after using this moisturizer? Pretty confusing if you ask me.<br /><br />All in all this product is just ok in my book. It felt ok on my skin, smelt bad to me at least and the instructions were weird to say the least. For this price you can get some other products that work better and definitely smell better!', 'This is a decent makeup brush set. Would I pay $40 for this, NEVER. First the bag is very nice. The 4 brushes that come with it are also very nice, but are they basically worth $10 a brush, no. For that kind of money you are better of buying a Sigma brush. I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well. None of these are outstanding and any better than you can find in the beginner sets you can get for like $10 to $20 depending on the set size. So getting the bag and supposed brush cleaner that I did not get does not warrent the $40 in my eyes.', 'This is a nice little concealer. I used it on some scars as well as skin blemishes and it worked alright for the most part. It was true to skin color. It covered the skin blemishes beautifully but not the scars. I had no issues blending it as long as you blend it right away and it look good after you were done. I would not use it as an eye shadow primer however because of its properties.', 'This pen basically is used to \"fill in\" larger pores with one end and the other end (black felt tip of sorts) helps smoothen it all out. The \"pink\" end is their primer that basically fills in whatever you want to cover up.<br /><br />This \"primer\" has no scent to it and is very soft and almost melts into your skin.  It has about light to medium coverage.', \"I really like this lip scrub. It tastes deliciously of peach and is nice and gentle. Let's face it you don't want something that is too harsh on your lips and scrub the heck out of them. You want something nice and smooth that gently scrubs away the excess skin that is oh so annoying and tempts you into biting it off.<br /><br />This scrub has Vitamin E, jojoba and coconut oil and some other nice ingredients and as I said tastes deliciously of peach. I personally am a huge fan of peach and this tastes 100% of peach and doesn't have a weird artificial flavor which is great. Thanks to the oils in this scrub your lips feel great after your wipe of the scrub.\", \"This is a very nice, well made scrunchie, but what I do not understand is, why one scrunchie is $17? I have gotten a 52 pack for $8 before and they are all very nice scrunchies. Yes I understand that the silk does not damage the hair and therefore doesn't cause split ends, but at this price it better blow dry my hair for me while I am still sleeping.<br /><br />It is beautiful, the color is a very nice deep emerald green, it is very well made, the silk has no pulled threads or anything, but I don't think I would be willing to spend that kind of money on just one. If this was a 5 pack or so I would be ok with it even for silk.\", 'My wife loves this. Hoping to get another one soon.....', \"As a licensed professional I do not recommend this product. My spa owner purchased this from Amazon, when I went to try it on a PAYING CLIENT,  the glue did absolutely nothing. If the glue doesn't work then the service cannot proceed. I have done this service on many clients with a different brand and had success. This product not at all.\", 'Not hand friendly but get the job done', 'Absolutely my FAVORITE!', 'It has a bad taste', \"I am willing to pay a few dollars extra for these razors.

They work for a long time and do not rust!  My first set last 4 years before I had to replace them.  I recommend only buying DORCO.\", 'Defective product. The strap was too small for my head but replacing it is not possible without ripping the hair out. The attachment on one side was in the hair on the front instead of the back of the head. So it would not work even if the stap did fit unless you folded it.  In addition, some of the hair was already falling out. I added a picture of the side which was not defective. I have it two stars but the color matched my hair exactly.', 'i bought for structure gel and builder gel.  I am happy with the brushes.', 'I’m pleasantly surprised, it’s a nice headband wig.

It sprays a very fine mist and my plants are doing great!', \"I love a peppermint scent, and I love when there are those oils to make your skin feel refreshed.  I thought that might be the case on your scalp with this shampoo, but it didn't.  I like the mix of peppermint and lavendar, and I think it worked just fine.  Overall, it works as well as any other shampoo.\", 'I\\'ve recently started doing my own \"dip powder\" nails, which lasts SO much longer than gel.  Plus, I don\\'t have to worry about getting a fungus from the salon.  They can be pretty tough to take off, so you HAVE TO have Acetone to get them off.  I can use this stuff on a little cotton ball, wrap my nail and cotton in tinfoil, and let them soak for a bit.  This does the trick and quickly brings the polish/powder off.  In short, it does what it\\'s supposed to do.', \"These are impossible to use!

Don't waste your money.\", 'I had this item sitting in my cart for a long time. I finally placed my order because the kit would basically pay for itself after one use.

The clip will fall.<br /><br />Many years ago,  I had a ton of hair and now,  sadly,  it has thinned out.  I now can use hair clips to hold the entire hair.  I like that the clips look simple,  they are not bulky and fit easily on my hair.  I usually use one  and/or two on the pony tail.  I can wear this clip on my hair in public and it is not very visible.  I am getting a lot of use right now.  I like the clips!  The Clips will hold a ponytail,  but eventually will slide.

The multi-purpose display is excellent, indicates how much time you have left before recharging and the time is plenty!  The storage case and charging stand are neat features.

I like the shades offered, and they are of good quality.', \"This is a very unique and effective product.<br /><br />Used with a light pre-styler on medium-length hair:<br /><br />Scent: It's a light scent. Warm and slightly spiced. Very pleasant and masculine.<br />Consistency: Extremely creamy. Becomes slightly tacky when emulsifying.<br />Styling: Smooth through the hair at first, with increasing tug the more you style. This is not a problem for me and is part of getting great hold from a product.<br />Finish: Slightly shiny at first, but becomes much more matte as it dries in the hair.<br />Hold: Legitimate all-day hold without becoming too rigid to restyle.<br /><br />This is one of my new favorites. Seriously good in all areas, which is so rare. TheSalonGuy has a real winner with this one.\", 'I really like this moisturizer. The consistency is extremely soft and smooth, and it feels incredible on my skin. It moisturizes wonderfully and feels like it actually fortifies the skin, making it feel thicker and stronger. The scent is very fresh and it absorbs well. I am already noticing (after a few days) a slight lightening of the skin under my eyes, which is exciting. A bit pricey, but definitely high quality.', 'These bottles are very good quality. All in perfect working order. They’re a great buy for the price.', 'Pricey, but it’s a high quality scrub. Great texture and exfoliation.', 'Aside from being a tad overpriced for a daily face wash, this stuff is great. It smells like cucumber - clean and fresh, it has the consistency of aloe vera gel but a bit thicker. The lather is low-foam. It feels great on my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. Definitely a high quality product.', 'Applying to medium length hair with a light prestyler.<br /><br />Scent: Very spicy. Christmas spices.<br />Texture: Waxy clay. Very thick.<br />Application: Thick and a bit tough to emulsify in the hands. A bit sticky during application.<br />Styling: Pretty responsive, but you have to work quickly.<br />Finish: Very high hold. Fairly low shine, but not matte.', 'This is a great product. The hold is strong, the finish is truly matte, and the price is a lot better than comparable clays, waxes and fibers. It has a light, masculine scent.', 'This is definitely a \"cooling\" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.', \"I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.\", \"This shampoo smells great. The scent is very natural, but unfortunately it's not. Rather than using the pricier essential oils of peppermint and lavender, the company uses synthesized fragrance. The lather is decent and washes your hair about as well as any bargain-priced brand from the supermarket shelf. I did notice that it leaves my hair feeling a bit flat. There is no reason for the high price aside from name familiarity, as this brand is used by some hotel chains.\", \"I really like the consistency of this face wash. It's like wet clay, with a gentle and pleasant scent. It has just the right amount of lather and it spreads very easily over my face. The only drawback is that is will dry your face out. I suppose this can be countered with a basic facial moisturizer.\", \"This body wash is excellent. The scent is delicious, like real orange, the lather is thick with small bubbles, and it noticeably moisturizes your skin. The only drawback is the price. It's currently listed for $10 for 4 ounces, which is basically travel size.\", \"I wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also! I was excited to finally have a water pick so when I received my package I immediately set it up and studied the directions. Once I was confident, I began and as soon as i turn it on, water went everywhere! It all ricochet ed all oclver my bathroom counter and mirror. Safe to say that you literally need to use this in the shower. But besides that, it has many attachments, different speeds and does a great job!\", \"This is my own personal experience with this lash growth enhancer and my own opinion. I did not notice any difference in my lashes since I started using it a month ago. I've documented my experience with pictures every 3 days. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen that it's worked for others but I guess it isn't compatible with my biology. I'm  bit disappointed.\", \"One liter almost lasted a year.... I forgot how much I spent but it's worth it\", \"This was a new thing for me to try.  I liked it but find myself not using it.  I thought maybe my wife would like it but it seems that she is not using it either.  It seems to take more soap than just using a washcloth.  I do like how it feels when I use it.  It feels nice on my body.  I won't give up yet, I will keep trying it.\", 'I ordered these as replacements. They arrived on time and were just what I needed. They were affordable and practical. Definitely worth purchasing.', 'Besame classic lipstick (Forever Red 1925) is creamy, moisturizing and conditioning. The color is a bright red, which gives you just the right amount of pop, especially if you are wearing a solid color (like black, blue or grey). I wish it was a deeper red, but regardless I will make it work. It makes my lips feel soft and smooth. It isn’t drying at all. It doesn’t bead on your lips. I wouldn’t consider this a matte finish, but it isn’t really shiny either. It has decent staying power (you can eat or drink while wearing it). Overall, this is a terrific lipstick to put in my rotation. I’d recommend it.', 'I like that this set (Fragrantshare) contains a variety of (make-up) brushes. You get 18 brushes in different shapes and sizes. You get everything from a foundation brush, to one that you can apply eyeshadow with. They (black) handles are easy to hold and use. The bristles are made of animal hair.  So, far I haven’t noticed any shedding. Everyone knows that you should change out your brushes every once in a while. So, give these a chance. Did I mention, this set is inexpensive, under $21 on Amazon.', 'The Ikoo Infusions hair mask was surprisingly great. It is moisturizing, hydrating and nourishing. This product comes in a round (6.8 oz) container. The thick (light green) cream smells refreshing and bright.  Some of the ingredients are macadamia oil, honey extract and camellia oil. It is non-greasy but does leave a slight shine. This product is cruelty, vegan, sulfate and paraffin free (Peta approved since that is important for some consumers). I have coarse, sometimes dry hair, that after using this product made it more manageable after just one treatment. I used it as a deep conditioning treatment. It left my scalp and hair feeling refreshed and clean. I’d recommend it.', 'Clearly Amazon has mis-priced this brush. $50, for a plastic handled brush and firm bristles? First, I am ok with the plastic handle. It is easy to grip and hold. And since it is plastic, you don’t have to worry about it looking faded after several washes (I do clean mine) like you do with the wooden ones. I’m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I’m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don’t like is the PRICE. I can’t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn’t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box. So, while I am sure I will use this brush, I can’t get over the price. 2 stars', 'LaClaire (Beverly Hills) Clarifying Cleanser is a delight on the skin. Simply add a dime sized amount, with a little water and distribute on your face with your hands (or if you prefer a loofah). The small (1.6 ounce) pump bottle is simple to use and doesn’t take up too much space in the cabinet or on the counter. There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I’ve used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world. Being socially aware of how their products can affect the environment and actively doing something about it is a company that I can support. You can reuse the bottle and add liquid soap or other things.', \"Ordered this for my son and he really loves it. He finds that this kit is helpful because there are a variety of tools that address most skin issues. He also likes there is a kit that holds all of the tools which means that he can keep them together and doesn't have to look for them when needed.  And finally, this kit was affordable and even more reasonable than some that I have seen in several discount stores.\", 'This is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can’t decide. I’m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn’t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven’t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven’t looked in the mirror and said “wow” or “gosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment”.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.', \"If you have larger head, these don't stay on. They're too tight and it causes them to slip strangely. I like the button idea though, and they worked fine for my regular headed coworkers.\", 'While these are cute they definitely did not slide around easily on the nail in order to get them into the right position all.', 'Love this wig priced reasonably hair is silky soft it curls perfect length and I was able to get it same day', \"I've never had high blood pressure but my blood pressure goes up really high when I use this product.

I was so excited to get these but once I felt them by excitement turned to disappointment. These are not worth 13.99 at all.', \"I'll admit, I was skeptical. I have never used a mud mask before. But I needed something! My skin was bumpy, irritated, and had lots of blackheads. I tried all the face washes and cleansers and they didn't do much. So I tried the Radha Beauty Dead Sea Mud Musk. I was very impressed! I left it on for about 7 minutes. It gives a nice minty tingle the whole time. If it starts to itch, you've left it on too long, get it off! I put a wet, hot cloth on my face for a moment to loosen it a bit, then just wipe it off, bit by bit.<br />My skin was SO SMOOTH, clear, and nice looking! I actually got compliments! I use it once to twice a week, but no more than twice. It really, really helps the look of my skin.<br />I was very skeptical but now I'm a convert!\", 'Love', 'Love this ! Great service too', 'Simply not strong enough to squeeze the paint from my oil paint tubes.  A cheap plastic version worked much better.', 'Tons of styles to choose from ranging from soft glam to dramatic.  Would be great for making gift sets for friends!', \"The quality of these items is really not that great. The combs and cape are pretty flimsy and everything feels inexpensive In general. This set would work if you really need it to but it'd be better to just pay slightly more for a better pair of scissors.\", \"I have a medium tan skin tone and this did not work for me at all. It's waaaay too light. Definitely meant for fair to light medium skin tones. This stuff is pretty pigmented so I wouldn't try it if you think it might be too light. It probably will be. Goes on pretty opaque and pigmented, it's almost a light/medium weight foundation. It does go in silky smooth and has a nice finish. I also like the pump and packaging. A bit of a scent to it, but it's not too bad. Wish they made this in more shades!\", \"I've tried the regular ones and love those. These don't stretch quite as well and feel a bit tighter when I wrap it around. I think they're alright but I prefer the normal ones much more.\", \"The polishes in this set work wonderfully and the packaging is very nice and would make an excellent gift! Unfortunately I bumped the lamp off my table and it fell about 3 feet and stopped working...I didn't think it was much of a fall so I was pretty surprised it didn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />The lamp was compact and easy to use, fit one hand at a time. Fortunately I have another lamp but pretty bummed this one broke so easily.:/\", \"(307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty! I like these a lot better than the 307's. I'd give these a 5 and a 307 a 3 so since they're the same brand, I will average the review to a 4.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!\", \"I have pretty long and decently full eyelashes so this mascara worked well for me as a daily mascara.<br /><br />Cute packaging, nice slim shape with cute design.<br /><br />I didn't find it to be too volumizing, but it does a good job at defining and lengthening.<br /><br />Formula was not very wet from first opening so this may dry out faster than others if not used up.<br /><br />My main issue with this mascara is the hard plastic applicator. It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already.

They're great!:)<br /><br />The little barettes are just okay, I find they pull my hair but the scrunchies are totally worth it.\", \"A pretty MLBB velvety lip color.  The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better.\", \"I tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this.

I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer.

I like being able to take my own shampoo with me because I hate the stuff they have in the hotels.', \"What a HORRIBLE product! Initial unboxing looked promising until the STENCH hit my nose! There was no relief from it. I gently soaked it in cold water with a baby shampoo and gently stirred it in one direction. The water instantly turned dark muddy brown. I let it soak in clean water 3x until the murky, dirty water ran cleaner. Then added a nice rich conditioner and a small spritz of argan oil. But these two little wigglets literally lost their appearance but still kept that terrible smell. Please save yourself the effort; use a different manufacturer. If I could give this item a -5 (negative 5) stars I would! I know they won't refund me after I washed it.\", \"This set comes with all colors displayed, a top coat, base coat, and matte top coat, also a nail file. The colors are pretty similar to the pictures, but slightly different. These colors show as very opaque and even with 3 coats they arent like the pictures. The green is more neon/clear and required 3 coats. The rest I only did two coats and cured for 60 seconds each coat in a 120w lamp. The purple is more magenta and has some pink undertones. The yellow is a little more lime green as well. I used dehydrator and a primer and when I put the base coat on, it would not smooth out and was lumpy. I'm not sure if it was the dehydrator and primer or the base coat itself, but I had to scrape it off and opted to note use it at all. I've only had the polish on for about a day, but have done a lot and there is no chipping so far.\", 'The wig is softer than most synthetic wigs and did not tangle for me and my son was playing in it. It is layered so it gives a more realistic look and has a little wave or curl at the ends. The part isnt really believable even with the lace. I would suggest a cap or hat over it. It did shed slightly for me when I was combing my hands through it.', \"Using this item made me feel like I was in the dentist's office. It was easy to setup and use. I plugged the poer adapter in, filled it with water, added the nozzle until it clicked, and pushed the dial to turn it on. There are different nozzles and in the instructions it says one is for general use, one for periodontal pockets, and another for fresher breath. There were some other accessories as well. It comes with a storage for those accesories. I used the general use nozzle and noticed that the dial has no arrow to tell you what strength you're putting it to, you would only know while the power is on and the stream is going. On the lower setting, the water was spurting, not flowing smoothly, but did on a higher setting. There is a suspension control to pause it while using it. After you are done, it instructs you to dump the water. Overall, it worked as it should and I gave it four stars because of the spurting and no arrow on the dial.\", \"They are not as long as I expected. I don't think I paid attention to the length, but if i hook two together they work. They are very secure though.

Received the first batch and they seemed tighter than what I wanted. Before I could contact the seller, they contacted me stating a batch was in circulation that was to tight.

The new bows are beautiful and are super soft on my daughters kinky curly hair.', \"My skin is very sensitive so I'm always careful to patch test and then I still can have trouble but this worked fine.

The charge didn't last long enough to get my hair done (I do have long and thick hair) so YMMV but the second time I tried to use it, it seems that the charge didn't even last as long as the first. Too much trouble for me. I was hoping for a true rechargeable product which would be excellent--if only this one delivered.\", \"I really liked using these. They seemed to have a really good effect, without irritating my very sensitive skin.

I wasn’t sure it would go through the sprayer but it does and it makes it so much easier to use.

Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.', \"I had a bit of trouble in the beginning getting this set exactly right for me but once it was set up (and I marked the spots the suction cups go onto) it's been a wonder. No more sore neck while soaking. I was worried about it staying damp but it doesn't. I do remove it when I'm not relaxing but it fits very nicely in my linen closet so it's only a second away.\", \"I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products.

It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product. If you don't have the time or want to bother with soaking the masque first, try something else but this does work!\", 'There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I’ve tried. They don’t hold well and I didn’t notice any improvement. I’ll keep shopping.', \"Once I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever.

With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products. It’s very helpful to see them in use and gives you ideas for your own nail art.

The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.\", \"HOW THIS COMES<br />This bar of soap comes wrapped in plastic with a label on each side.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />This bar of soap is very crumbly before unwrapped.  The soap feels like it will crumble but when you put water on it, it turns into a very muddy bar of soap.  You can feel the mud in it.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />This does clean the skin well, but if you have normal to dry skin, it really does make it feel stripped and tight when done using it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />There is nothing in this bar of soap to indicate its ingredients other than Dead Sea Mud.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN<br />Israel<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS<br />Anyone with very dirty greasy skin or who has problems with oil and blemishes might be able to use this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This bar of soap does not list ingredients but you can definitely feel there is a lot of mud in it.  It cleans well but strips the skin.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  No ingredient list took a star off for me.  The performance is good for some skin, but mine is more on the normal to dry side so I don't use it as much as the guys do.\", 'I have been looking for some shampoos to help with cleaning hair, but also making the scalp heal for nice hair growth and also flaking.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes wrapped tight in plastic with the pump down.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />Once the plastic is open, you turn the pump to make it pop up and then you can dispense the shampoo.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The bottle is only 6 inches from the base to the top of the pump.  It is pretty small.<br /><br />SCENT<br />My mom found a really old bottle of shampoo in her attic that was by Fabrege called Farrah Fawcett shampoo.  This scent reminds me of that.  It is a really nice smelling shampoo.<br /><br />SCALP<br />I did feel some tingling in my scalp when using this.  It did not burn or hurt at all, it felt nice.<br /><br />HAIR CLEAN?<br />I have very fine hair which is easily weighed down.  It is hard to find a shampoo that encourages volume, does not make my hair look flat, and that does not make it full of static.  This shampoo leaves my hair clean for a few days and it somewhat encourages waves.  I can not comment on static, as it is not near winter yet.  My hair was not left dry or frizzy at all.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shampoo.  It is a small bottle, but a little bit goes a long way.  It makes my scalp feel better and leaves my hair nice and clean.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I wish the bottle was not so small, but I do like the shampoo.  I was going to give this to my daughter (she has scalp issues) but I think I will buy her a 2nd one and keep this one for me.', \"I have tried many high end skin products over time and I also make my own skin care which I use a lot as well.  Once in a while I like to check out another line to trade off for a while.  This line, Wow.  I am impressed so far.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  The bottle inside is glass with a lock pump top.  Turn to the side and you can pump and then turn it back and it locks.<br /><br />TEXTURE OF THE LOTION<br />This is what I would think of as a lotion texture.  Thick, but not too thick.<br /><br />MY SKIN TYPE<br />I tend to have normal to dry skin and it has some uneven patches on it which most probably don't notice, but I do.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I start with the XXI cleanser which is great stuff.  Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway).  I really have been thankful to have them right now.  They have given me a boost when I really needed one.\", 'I have baby fine hair.  That means that although I can make it look like I have quite a bit of hair, in reality, my pony tail is the size of a watercolor brush.  I need hair ties that can pull my hair back, stay put, and not destroy what hair I do have.<br /><br />HOW THESE COME<br />These come in a plastic bag.<br /><br />COLOR<br />The colors are all brilliant neon which I LOVE, except the blue- I would call it neon navy if that were a thing.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />These work perfectly for me.  I use them alone on hot days and even have them stay put during exercise and activity.  They do not tear out my hair when I remove them either.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These hair bands are perfect for me.  I have baby fine hair and not as much of it as it looks, so having these is perfect.  They also work well for kids.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am thrilled to have these.  Most other hair bands slide out easily and frustrate me.  These stay put most of the time.', 'As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.', \"I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.\", \"I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.\", \"I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.\", \"I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\", 'I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let\\'s take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.', \"I was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\", \"When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\", \"When it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.\", \"I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.\", 'We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.', 'I am a total mascara girl won’t leave the house without it. This by far is the best collection. The weight of it is spectacular it doesn’t feel like you’re way down. The white tube gives you that volume and that length let it dry and then apply either one of the mascaras and you will see your eyelashes look like you’re wearing falsies.

It was hard to work with. I had to warm it in a cup of very hot water first to even be a little pliable. Even tho it has a little American flag on the advertisement it is not made in USA very misleading. I have used about 3 different polygel sets like this and this one was the hardest to use by far. But I gave it a try because the one I usually use was out of stock. I used all the different colors but all with the same ending.....disappointing!!!! So sad  because I had high hopes after waiting almost three weeks to receive it during these trying times due to covid. This NY GIRL unfortunately disapproves and is very disappointed!!!!!', 'Look great but nothing natural about it. She’d like crazy. I was hoping to love this wig but I really dislike it.', 'This wig cost $18 and it feels super luxurious! The hair fibers are super soft and easy to manage! I love the ombré coloring, it is so nicely done! The wig looks super realistic, I wish my hair was actually like this!', 'I have purchased these swabs twice now and they never disappoint! They are tightly wound so no cotton falling off in my ears. I use them for hygiene purposes but I think the wooden stems make them great for paint/glue crafting projects!', 'I ordered a set of MUSE & Co Dazzling Collection 36 Stick-On Gel Nails Medium Length, French Sparkle for review.  Having preteen and a teenager in the house who love all things beauty, I felt they may like these.  The set has both plain and bedazzled nails.  The being was just to big and stuck up too far, often catching on clothes.  The had pretty good adhesion for a day or two then began coming up.  Overall nothing special, but the did work temporarily.', \"I ordered a set of 'Qiray 36 Pieces, 18 Colors Large Retractable Cotton Hair Ties Hair Bands, Suitable for All Hair Thickening Hairstyle' for review.  Both my daughters and wife have longer hair and go through a multitude of hair ties.  These are reasonably priced and are well made for hair ties.  My daughter told me these are her favorite hair ties.  They do not get caught up in her curls, nor do they get tangled when they are removed.  They have good stretch and hold her thick hair well.  These are nice and wide.  Overall, these are a good economical option for hair ties.\", \"I ordered the 'Padgene Makeup Vanity Mirror with Lights,1x 2X 3X 5X 7X Magnification 360°Adjustable Rotation 4-Fold 34 LED Lighted Mirror with Touch Screen,Stand Height & Brightness Adjustable (White)' for review.  This mirror comes fully assembled and is quite simple to use.  It has a touch button to turn on the light.  It has multiple magnifications.  The ability to fold it up so it takes less space is also beneficial making it easier to store or take up less space on your counter top.  The mirrors are clear without scratches or flaws.  The stand is plastic, so it may not be as durable as a mirror with a metal base or stand.  The price point does seem a little high for the quality, but my wife really likes this mirror and uses it everyday.  Overall, this is a well made mirror with great magnification.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!\", \"I ordered 'Native Deodorant - Natural Deodorant - 3 Pack Seasonal' for review.  this set comes with three different scents  Each scent is light and not overpowering.  The deodorant is soft and goes on smoothly.  My wife, who has to use an extra strength deodorant has been pleased with the odor control.  Her sensitive skin has no issues with this deodorant.  Overall a great natural product.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!\", 'I ordered a ‘Boar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle’ for review.  My wife has curly hair that can be difficult to tame.  When this brush arrived, my younger daughter who has very long curly hair wanted to try it out.  When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.  Overall, this is a nicely made brush, that works well, and worth its price point.', 'I ordered the \\'Beast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz\\' for review.<br />I love to try different beard oils. This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It\\'s a very \"cologne\" type scent which I really don\\'t care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn\\'t like the scent at all.', 'I ordered this Veta – Lash and Eyebrow Serum – 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen for review.  My teenage daughter was willing to try it out for me and these are her thoughts.  \"The pen application is not difficult.  However, if you accidentally get it in your eyes it stings really badly.  I had used it a couple of times before that happened. But, now I don\\'t want to use it again.\"<br /> Unfortunately she did not use it long enough to see if there was any lash growth.  If my wife is brave enough to try it I will update my review.', \"I ordered the 'Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Leakproof Foldable Squeezable Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap (Pack of 2)' for review. My daughter has her favorite hair products that she has to pack when we travel and it's never fun packing those large bottles and other travel containers are just to small and or hard to fill. This set is so nice with the wide mouth openings which make them easy to fill and as you use the product, up they collapse to take up less space plus make it much easier to get every last drop of that precious product out haha. We have tried other compact TSA approved toiletry containers and I will say that these are so much more functional than the others, and most definitely of greater value.\", \"I like that this is aluminum free, made in Germany, etc. The scent isn't ideal for me. I'm sensitive to fragrance and this is very strong. Smells like baby powder. I prefer the men's scents which are usually more toned down but I couldn't find a Nivea men's without aluminum.\", 'Other than my husband saying this looks like a torture kit from the movies, this little set has a lot of options for the price.  My husband had no idea how to use most of the tools it comes with, and frankly, there are a few that have even stumped me. But, I love the masculine black look of the tools and so did he. The packaging looks very nice and professional and the leather is soft and bends easily—this made it easy to tuck it into a larger bathroom bag. All of the clippers seem to work well without issue. I did take one star off because the little pair of scissors are really thin and flimsy. The first time my husband took them out to cut his large toenail, it bent them. But, other than that, the rest seem well made and sturdy and he said he will continue to use them... and secretly, I want him to have his own pair so he quits taking mine out of my makeup bag and losing them. :)', \"For me, I had tried many times to deal with a couple of spots on my skin. Nothing I tried worked, so I then I was this and thought I'd try it. After a couple of weeks of putting it on those spots, they are almost gone. I would recommend that you try it if, like me, you tried everything without success.\", 'Good thought mask were included ?', \"This is a nice sized palm brush - slightly smaller than some I've seen, and easy to handle. The boar bristles are a nice moderate stiffness and seem to do a good job, even with my thinning hair. Boar bristles are known.to provide benefits to the scalp as well as redistributing natural oils through your hair.\", 'The scent you can feel? I wasn\\'t certain what that could mean, but now that I\\'ve used it, I get it. I dont know if it\\'s the caffeine or the tea tree oil... or maybe its eucalyptus, but it does have a tingling effect on your skin. And that tingling effect is not just some slight effect, its noticable. In fact, certain times (and xertain areas of skin), it\\'s almost too much. As such, I dont use this daily.<br /><br />As for scent - it is a strong but pleasant scent that smells like it feels... and again, it strikes me as a bit strong. I have some Beast \"Blue\" beard oil that has the same scent. It cleans nicely and the scent stays with you as you go about your day.', 'This beard oil from \"The Beast\" seems like it\\'s pretty good for the health of your beard. It\\'s only got a cou po le of ingredients, argon oil and jojoba oil... similar to some other beard oil I\\'ve tried. And it does seem to keep your beard soft and shiny. It also lists a scent among its ingredients. The scent is certainly \"manly\", but to me, it\\'s more of an oil like scent... It\\'s not unpleasant and it\\'s not overpowering... but there.', \"Lots of tools in a compact set. I was afraid this set might be huge, taking up too much precious space in a suitcase for travelling. But not...  in fact, they've done a nice job of effort iently using space in this leather, folding case. The tools themselves are decent... not great, but they'll get the job done and the fact that they've got just about any need covered makes this an ideal item to toss into a suitcase for a trip. Nicely packaged, it would also make a nice gift.\", 'I scratched my eyebrows trying to get the pencil color onto my brow.', 'Not great for a wider face. The stencil is not wide enough.', 'Great disposable shower cap for coloring  your hair or using purple hair masks at home. I should have bought these years ago.', \"I used this scrub right before shaving my legs and it made the floor of the shower extremely slippery. I didn't mind that, but the scrub leaves behind a super thick layer of candle wax looking stuff that was impossible to get off my legs. I had to scrub with a washcloth and soap to even make a dent. While shaving, huge globs of the candle wax looking stuff were on the razor. I love bath and body works, but they really missed the mark on this one\", 'I have used this product for years .Anytime my tummy is upset I take a couple of drops and it always makes it feel better .', 'Wow! I was hesitating about ordering this product because of the price and after reading multiple reviews about different colors of the same polish that didn’t have application thick enough. There were no reviews on this color (authentic apricot) and I decided to give it a try. I must say that I’m very pleasantly surprised. The picture I attached was taken on the 4th day after application and this is ONLY 1 COAT! Usually, all nail polishes start peeling the same day, because I do a lot cooking/cleaning but this one holds so well, I’m just amazed. And I should say that with the clean ingredients list and such a strong application it’s worth the price. I felt like I had to leave this review to support the seller. Thank you to the company for making such good products!', 'This beard wash has a great and real sandalwood smell. Lathers well and has a great cleaning effect on the beard.

Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.<br />Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair. My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded. I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items. It feeds your hair and body.<br />How I apply this I squeaze a small amount (pea size) onto one palm then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm- then lay my hands on area and massage in-it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc. it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%. If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.<br />Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.<br />I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.<br />Just my 2 cents....', 'Love them.

Bunches of the horse hair fell out of the brush immediately.', 'Product was late arriving.  Amazon refunded price and did not need product returned.  Overall did not see much difference with dry skin.  Used daily.', \"This is a lip stain, not lipstick. And yes, they're cotton swabs. You break one end so it flows to the other, and there's a LOT of stain in each cotton swab (there's 20 in the box, each wrapped in plastic). I think you can get two uses out of each one, but obviously, they're meant for single use.<br /><br />This stain works VERY well. The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery. So this would be great for going out for drinks or doing anything where you avoid greasy food. Also, the instructions on the box are in Chinese.\", \"What I like about this set is that you get three different colors with this set, in case you need to blend to match your brow color (you can always give away the ones you don't use), and that it includes an eyeliner as well. Both worked well (they weren't dried out for me at all), flowing easily and with good lasting power. A great set for the price.\", \"I've read about these and wanted to give them a try; you wet them with warm water (or micellar water) then wipe with off your makeup with them. They really do work, and feel so nice since they're very soft! Sometimes I press them gently against my eyes for a moment or two to help remove the more stubborn makeup, or gently rub. You wash once they're full of makeup, putting them in a garment bag, and I try to put them in a wash with no fabric softener.\", \"This is a great makeup sponge and works just as well as others that cost a lot more. You can use it damp or dry (I moisten it when I'm applying liquid foundation, but can use it dry when cleaning up eye shadow or applying some blush). It's nice and soft so it feels good against the skin, and applies the makeup in an even fashion.\", \"Okay, I love eyeshadow palettes and probably have too many, and they range in price and brand. I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.\", \"I've heard of face cream made from snails (or their secretions) and was a bit hesitant to give it a try. This is from Korea so perhaps that's not so surprising, and has a nice citrus scent to it, is a nice thick cream (no SPF) that does a really good job moisturizing my skin. It absorbs quickly and gives it a nice, dewy look and does seem to provide some tightness to it.\", \"I'm pretty happy about the LumaRx facial cleansing brush. It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter – this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.\", \"didn't work for me... slides off, have tried to wear it on either side and still the same.

I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.', 'They put me to sleep in 10 mins! Very addicted-))))) They smell nice!', \"Colors are NOT like the pictures. Very sheer and the magnet does not do anything. Don't waste  your money\", 'Great quality! Just what I expected!', 'This natural hand cream has a lovely pear scent and really moisturizes very well without feeling greasy. It is a very small \"cute\" jar and is a bit pricey for the size. It is a great hand cream. Will want to purchase again.', \"I really like this color stick. The pink lemonade is so pretty and leaves just a little shimmer on your skin. For me it lasted a day on my face so that was good. The package is small but still good for the price. I'm happy with this purchase.\", \"I can't say enough good things about these versatile Wonder Clips by Handi Stitch.  I recently received a package of 50 of these with 10 large clips and have used them on a daily basis for so much more than just holding fabric together for stitching seams.  Even this small size holds together leather so I find that I don't need to rubber cement the pieces together as I have done in the past to hold the pieces together.  Kids love these, too, so be prepared to find that you need more than you ever anticipated.  I received samples for evaluation and love these clips.\", \"eb5 line has been around for some time now and I have noticed their advertisements in print media over the years, but have not tried any of the line until I received this bottle of Collagen Booster Serum.  I am very surprised that I like this serum as much as I do, and I am more surprised at the competitive pricing for the entire line.  With no added fragrance, my sensitive skin responded well to the light and creamy product that was readily absorbed.  My skin was prepared for moisturizing and there was no irritation or annoyance due to a fragrance of the natural components which can occur.  The pump action is terrific and the cap keeps it protected from the elements, yet it is quick to remove for application.  There is no excessive packaging, so little waste.  Many years ago, Robert Heldfond Jr. and I were casual friends in San Francisco, occasionally having coffee together in North Beach, and I have thought of him each time I would see his father's picture in the advertisements I mentioned earlier.  I very much like to support family businesses and am pleased to finally try the product from his company which now has his wife at the helm.  I look forward to trying other products in the line.\", \"Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities.  MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.  I also love the rounded design in the sections of the taller component.  Every aspect of this trio is outstanding, high quality, and it makes quite the impression in addition to comfortably storing whatever you like in each compartment.  Each edge is finished, every detail has been considered, and it is even practical in that it can quickly be cleaned with no harsh detergents. This lovely item was made in China and it is clear that quality control is important to the manufacturer because I saw no defect even after intense examination.  Be prepared for a weightier set than you might expect, because there was no skimping on the materials.  It is perfectly packed for protection and is ideal for presenting as a gift.  It is well worth its price point.  A sample was provided for review.\", 'Love the feel on my skin.

I do not like the smell as it goes on as it smells like tea tree oil to me even though that is not in the product.  The smell does dissipate after 20 minutes.  It is rich and creamy, but not greasy.

I have bleached blonde wavy hair that constantly frizzes in the summer, in the rain, if I don't dry it enough - you get the idea, it is often frizzy.  I tried it and it does a great job cleaning my hair and the smell is just amazing.  However, I can't say that it's been a real miracle that changed my hair.  I mean, I like it but based on some of these reviews, maybe I was just looking for a miracle for bad hair and it isn't, at least for my hair.  I accidentally ordered two bottles of this when I intended to order one, and I plan to use them up, but I'd probably try something else after I'm done with the two bottles to see if there is some type of miracle for my dry/frizzy hair.\", 'Does what it is supposed to do.

Different countries have varying standards on liquids in carry on luggage and no matter what country, these containers will meet those standards.  If you use these for an over night stay somewhere, or have an unexpected stay at an airport hotel, they should be able to hold enough supplies for that, but not for more than maybe 2 days.<br /><br />They are sturdy plastic, opaque containers and are flexible enough to squeeze the contents out. The caps are push in type and is better than the lift up caps where the cover can easily break off.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when you buy other travel container sets, I find that a few of the containers are useless, like the spray bottle and the little &#34;pill&#34; container with the screw off lid, at least for my needs.  This particular set has all of the type of containers that I needed, and more than enough for all the products that I carry.', 'Buy these. They feel great and work quickly!

Also works well with essential oils for my stinky homemade mosquito sprays. I also have some perfumes that I love but which are too overpowering for my own sensitive nose, so I like diluting them with this perfumer's alcohol so they are more pleasant to wear.\", \"This is, I think, my third order of Rio De Keratin. I'm able to get 3-4 treatments out of each kit with my hair ranging from super short to just below my shoulders. I usually still iron my hair, but it stays flat, even in Alabama's subtropical humidity. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what I do: by the time I walk from my house to the car, my hair is frizztastic. But with a keratin treatment, I can even just blow dry my hair and it look fantastic. This saves so much more time and it makes styling last for days. I also hike and get sweaty and my hair still looks great after it dries. Once, after a day of kayaking, I rode in the back of a friend's truck back to the marina, and my hair still looked terrific. This of all things has given me the hair I've dreamed of. And at $10-$15 per treatment, this price is right.<br /><br />Of course, it does smell terrible. And the fumes can sting your eyes, both as you apply it to your hair and as you iron it out. I like to open the back door and aim a cyclonic fan into the bathroom while I use this stuff so I don't choke on the fumes.\", 'Since there aren’t any reviews for this product, I thought I would write one for those who aren’t familiar with the brand, or the item. I’m now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn’t require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it’s the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it’s a wonderful product, however it’s outrageously overpriced for what’s a ‘trial size’ and ‘free’ gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it’s around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8” high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size. Another thing I want to mention is that I have sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this product line! You’re face will thank you!', \"I liked this particular scent much more than others that I've tried, from both Michel Design and other brands. The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad! My only negative comment is that the peony scent doesn't last long enough!\", \"This is one of La Prairie's less expensive moisturizers and it's good. It can be used day and/or night alone or over a serum or one of their other products per directions. I use this cream during the day because I don't really need a sunscreen. I've also used this at night when I run out of night cream. In my opinion all of La Prairie's products are excellent and worth the high price - I don't use makeup so it's important for me to make my face look as good as it can be. I'm 61 years old and have been using this line for about 7 years. Depending on skin type and age I think some of their products work better than others. As with all their products a little goes a long way. The current price on Amazon is quite a bit lower than what I have to pay in a department store which is more than $200 for the same size jar!\", 'The title says it all. I love this stuff.

If you are not accustomed to using glycolic acid be careful with this brand. It is very potent. I suggest mixing a small amount with a moisterizer. I do that for my neck. A bit of redness and peeling is common. I will absolutely order again.', 'This product was introduced to me by a local Beauty Spa. I just absolutely fall in love with the scent.<br />I usually place a dab or two behind my ear, use it like a perfume product.<br />This scent is so perfect pairing with my yoga practice.', \"I had high hopes for this little baby, but after using for a few days, I must say it's just &#34;okay&#34;.  Perhaps it may be because when I bought it I had thick (or used to before my brush starting feasting on it) hair down to my butt and was tired of finding enough to knit my cat a sweater in my hair brush every morning.  So I wanted something that was more user friendly.  But then on an impulse I cut my naturally curly hair very short.<br /><br />The Pros:  It seems sturdy and well-made with a nice grain.  It's smooth (the teeth on the plastic picks tend to splinter and peel with time).  It feels comfortable to use.  It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.  This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you.  I also wish the handle were a bit longer.\", \"Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.

It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored.

I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.\", 'If you use this body scrub after you use soap it leaves a nice layer of moisture on your skin.

I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", \"Goop Beauty's hand cream is soothing and deeply moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands looking nourished and hydrated. The skin on your hand will almost look a little plump, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I had high expectations for this cream after trying the lip balm and I was not disappointed. The tube is fairly small, but perfect for a purse or pocket. I have my tube on my bedside table for use before bed. This is one of the best hand creams you will ever use. The secret? Shea butter as one of the top ingredients. You may want to get more than one tube! With all the handwashing we've all done in the past two years it is nice to have a cream that is protective and healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", 'If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect.

I\\'d say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can\\'t be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don\\'t mind when characters don\\'t like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...\"Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?\" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', 'I keep a bottle of this lotion in three rooms of my house because I love it that much. I have one in the bathroom on the counter, one in the kitchen and one on my bedside table. That way any time I need a hand cream this is available. I also use this as a body lotion. This is the one Zum fragranced cream that smells the best to me and the scent dissipates quickly after use. To be honest my hands look ten years younger when using this particular lotion. There are a lot of essential oils in it so I think it is antiaging. I also love the particular scent of the Bulgarian lavender.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', 'Are you looking for the ultimate in squeaky clean skin? This citrus-based mask cleanses pores like a dream, removing oil and dirt while softening skin too. You will need to moisturize after using this as your skin will feel a little tighter and drier. If you have oily problem skin, this will impress. Leave it on 8 minutes for the best effect. The texture of this mask is a little like firm whipping cream instead of clay. It is easy to apply and remove with a little extra care. You will immediately notice how absolutely purified your pores look. Impressive!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', \"If your hair takes a lot of abuse with heated drying and hot styling tools this fine mist creates a glistening moisturizing shine on your hair. I've been finding out lately how the hemp plant can make you more beautiful and even lose weight and cause your skin to be clear. This hair shine product is the icing on the cake of your hemp expenditures.<br /><br />The scent of this oil is very mild and pleasant. The oil is such a fine mist that it does not weight down the hair and seems to absorb well leaving a glossy shine. I saw this product a while ago and finally purchased some for myself! It will impress you with its natural ingredients and beautifying effects. I love it and I think after doing research around you will find this is the best shine product.<br /><br />This ships in a plastic bag but I did not find it leaking at all! Happy about that!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", 'Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo has the wonderful fresh scent of an apple orchard. It is moisturizing like a cream shampoo and in combination with the conditioner these products smooth, strengthen and gloss each strand.<br /><br />After the first use I could feel how my hair was thickening and getting stronger. But by the third use of both the shampoo and the conditioner I could really tell a difference.<br /><br />I love the scent and how it makes my hair endure styling, blow drying and straightening. Your hair will be shinier too. I love these products as much as LUSH shampoos and conditioners and that is saying a lot!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', \"I enjoy using Zum Bar Goat Milk Soaps and this one is no exception. It is very nicely scented and has a slight exfoliating action due to what appears to be bits of seaweed in the soap. I can't guess what the essential oils are in this soap but they are heavenly. I noticed the scent of this soap is very calming. Love it!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", 'As a fan of the philosophy lip glosses I used to use the vanilla cake one which I miss not being able to purchase on its own these days. So this is my second favorite and it is nice and sparkly, mildly flavored, not overly sweet and definitely not sticky. What is not to love?<br /><br />I use a lip balm first, apply a lipstick and then put this on top to hold the look together. It lasts quite a while or until you eat something, then you need to reapply. But I put this on before I go out and it lasts for hours. So I hope this flavor is going to be around for a while. :) I will admit that sometimes I even wear this one to bed! Love, love love!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', \"I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It is man sized and will last a long time. He is using it now in the winter but I hear it is heat stable in the summer as well so he can leave it in the car. This tube is about three times the size of Burt's Bees lip balm. So if you want to make a man in your life happy this is the thing to buy. Chapped lips are no fun. This solves a big problem year round and is minty fresh too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", \"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.<br /><br />The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes.\", \"If you live in a dry climate you will especially love this moisturizing, calming mask. It goes on like a gel and cools the skin while it refreshes your complexion. I can't say enough good things about this mask. I have sensitive skin and it calms redness and irritation completely. The truth is you will want to use this every day. I put the mask on at night before bedtime and leave it on for ten minutes. Once washed off my skin is baby soft and plumper. Hours later it still feels like my face is cool and comforted. It especially helped to calm my skin down after I used a serum with retinol in it. So this is something I will want on hand at all times as it is very healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", \"Does dry weather get you down because your hands feel uncomfortable and dry? Welcome to the experience of J.R. Watkins hand creams. I've tried nearly every scent and love them all. I have a lavender one I love using at night. This one is great for daytime as it is floral scented. You really don't need a lot so it lasts a lot longer than other less rich hand creams. This one is super moisturizing with luxurious shea butter, apricot kernel oil, coconut oil, aloe leaf juice and safflower seed oil. It also has a calming flower extract. So your hands get pampered to the max. I've pretty much stopped buying other hand creams and just reach for this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", \"I have never purchased pure cocoa butter before but I needed some for making some body butter. I found it very difficult to get this butter out of the container. I managed to get half a cup out with a dessert spoon. I can't see how anyone could use this on a regular basis. I'd only recommend it for making natural recipes. It has a very strong scent of chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\", \"I recently made myself a body butter and used this oil in place of the almond oil the recipe called for. It worked really well. I will say however that this one bottle seems to be 125 ml as it filled up a half a cup. Using this in the body butter made the butter very luxurious. I now use it nightly on my hands and feet. You could also use this as a massage oil. I'm finding this really does make my skin look younger. After about a week you may notice a difference too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.\", \"Why pay tons of money for a French manicure when it is so easy to do at home on your own schedule? I recommend the O3 color set as the pink color is very natural. You may want to use tip guides or you can just wing it. I didn't use tip guides and it came out great. Having a French manicure makes you look so elegant. I also found that the pink nail polish looks great on your toes.

This look is so pretty.\", 'Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as \"Azure\" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review', 'If you have sensitive skin and dislike the abrasive quality of most exfoliating washes, then the Start Up Exfoliating Wash may impress you.<br /><br />The clean smooth feeling of the citrus scented gel is a pleasure for your face.

These oils are over $30 for 5ml and, while it works great and smells amazing, I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that knowing that I have a box full of single oils.<br />When I saw this bottle with the pump, I knew it was time to try my hand and mixing this recipe.  I had a few other rollerballs that I wanted to make (some decongestant and immune boosters since it’s getting to that time of year) so I inserted the pump and got to work.  The oils mixed VERY well and the pump on the bottle made it very easy to dispense just enough into the small rollerball opening.  That is SUCH a nice feature – manufacturer, please don’t remove that from the item.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it’s thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I’m soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby’s back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).

The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes?

Its EXTREMELY precise and beyond easy to use. It is by far genuinely the EASIEST liquid eyeliner I have used in my 25plus years of using liquid liners. The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!\", 'I have tried many face products over the years but nothing has seemed to work.

Attach the upper half with your eyes at the center and the lower half with your mouth at the center. Tip! It is better to attach the lower part first. STEP 3. Absorption.

The packaging was not good and I had these pods falling all over the place. What is in each pod? Got me. Makes my face feel good though.

She did this for a few years and has since stopped, but the hairs on her torso are now an embarrassment for her.\", \"You will need a nail gel lamp to cure the gel. From my experience with different lamps, leave your nails in the curing lamp for the maximum time. This is quite handy and easy to use. Follow all instructions and you should get great results.

Boredom slightly reduced.<br /><br /> The dark purple and aqua is the coolest. Three colors really, dark purple, Cobalt blue, and light aqua. Blue to silver is more blue to light blue, but still cool.<br />Polish lasts for days if i prep my nails properly. Like most glitter polishes, they don't have a completely smooth finish without multiple coats of topcoat, but I don't mind.\n",

Before I had to use nearly an entire bottle of conditioner just to make my hair manageable post shower. Now I barely use any conditioner. I use a detangling / leave-in conditioner spray (Unite 7 Seconds is awesome by the way) and then I brush through with this brush and it goes through without ripping out my hair and getting stuck. It's not fancy, and arrived with the black logo on the back nearly scratched off but who cares - it works.\n",

There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.\n",

            "I like it. I'll use nearly anything so long as it doesn't dry my skin out, and even better if it has healthy ingredients. This hits those marks, and at the new low price of $5, it is a pretty decent body wash (originally I have it written down at just under $20). Obviously this is a much more budget friendly price. I have a facial cleanser by Hylunia I really like, and this has a similar feel to it. I would use this on my face while in the shower with no problems. It is gentle and non irritating!<br />It isn't super sudsy, but it lathers plenty enough to feel like I am covering my body and cleansing it. I always follow up with a moisturizer, and I thought my skin actually felt extra soft the next day (I take my showers before bed). Smells good!\n",

            "WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2\". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5\". Many are 1\" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.\n",

I admit it smells like an essential oil and contains lavender, cypress and sweet orange, all scents I like.<br /><br />The oil is not very heavy and absorbs into your skin fairly quickly. It is a quite oily though and takes quite some time to absorb into your skin. But you can expect that from a face oil if you ask me. Unlike another oil from Lua this one stays oily though, not sure why that is. Because of the oil your face is soft though but that is mostly because of that greasiness.

I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.\n",
