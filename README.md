# NLPproj2024

notebook in the repo contain some graph drawing code and annotations on what we expect/observe.  
main.py is created so torch models run more smoothly. (Or in my case, runs at least)  

The main.py and title.py files were used to train the generative LSTM model.
The NLP_Project_BERT.ipynb was used to test the BART model.
